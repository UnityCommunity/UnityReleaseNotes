Patch 2017.3.1p1
Released: 14. February 2018

Changes

    Asset Import: Adjusted messaging around Substance Designer import removal.
    XR: Android builds that enable ARCore no longer fail when the minimum Android SDK is less than 24.
    XR: Standalone UWP applications targeting Windows Mixed Reality will now cause the OS to notify the user if the Mixed Reality components are not installed or a headset is not connected, rather than silently falling back to non-VR desktop mode.
