Patch 2017.2.0p1
Released: 6 November 2017

Improvements

    2D - Exposed methods to set and retrieve Physics Shape from a Sprite.
    2D - Sprites created by importing a texture now have a default Physics Shape generated.
    Graphics - Added APIs to retrieve areas safe for UI rendering. Currently supported on iOS and tvOS only.
    iOS - Added identification enums for iPhone 8, 8+ and X.
    Shaders - Concatenated matrix macros (e.g. UNITY_MATRIX_MVP) are now changed to static variables to avoid repeated calculations.
    tvOS - Implemented support for 4K AppleTV icons and splashscreens.
    XR - Improved performance on Windows Mixed Reality by removing a potential thread stall that would occur whenever beginning a new frame while the previous frame had not completed presenting.
