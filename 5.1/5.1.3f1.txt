5.1.3f1 Release notes
Features

    Tizen: Static splash screens are now supported.

Improvements

    Android: Added support for real 16bit RGB565 backbuffer.
    iOS: Make WWW.text to actually contain error response in case of non-200 status.
    Physics: Renamed 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.None' to 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.Discrete' (Will be auto-updated).
    VR: Added an option to allow Cameras to render specifically to left/right eye for stereo 3D.
    WebGL: Added WebGLInput.captureAllKeyboardInput API to allow web page content to get keyboard input.

Changes

    BlackBerry: SystemInfo.deviceModel now returns a useful model string value instead of a hexadecimal number.
    Samsung TV: Users are now able to set the system language via SamsungTV.SetSystemLanguage. Users will need to fetch the system language via Samsung's GSP API plugin.
    Windows Standalone: Player exe is no longer signed, icon and version modifications will no longer have digital signature errors.
    Xbox One: Unity is now built using the June 2015 QFE 1 XDK. You will need to have this XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or a later recovery.
