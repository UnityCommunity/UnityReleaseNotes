5.1.1f1 Release notes
Feature

    VR: Gear VR is now supported with Unity VR.

Improvements

    Editor: Added MonoDevelop Solution Properties toggle to External Tools to disable writing of MonoDevelopProperties section to .sln files.
    Graphics: Added hexadecimal code support to Color (TryParseHexString, ToHexStringRGB and ToHexStringRGBA).
    Graphics: Added set to gpu skinning parameter in PlayerSettings.
    Input: Mouse cursor will be confined to rendered area in Windows standalone (when CursorLockMode.Confined is used).
    iOS/IL2CPP: Lower memory used by IL2CPP executables at runtime by removing unused overhead from memory profiling and making more data constant.
    Linux: Removed "faulty GPU driver" workarounds for Intel drivers that claim to support OpenGL 3.0+.
    Mecanim: Show frame number in avatar previewer.

Changes

    Mecanim: AnimatorState runtime speed is now a multiplier apply on the orignal speed rather than an override.

    iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed an issue which sometimes caused IL2CPP to not call static constructors when Unity created class instances from native code.
