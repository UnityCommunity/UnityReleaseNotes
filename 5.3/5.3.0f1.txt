5.3.0f1 Release notes
Installer Change

Installers have been componentized to allow for more control over what’s installed with Unity. Please utilize the Download Assistant for full control. The Editor component is now minimized to be the editor, webplayer and MonoDevelop
System Requirements Changes

    Windows XP support for running the Editor is dropped
    Windows XP SP1 dropped for Windows Player and Web Player support (XP SP2+ required)
    Windows Store Apps 8/Windows Phone 8 support is dropped (previously deprecated in 5.2); 8.1 apps are the minimum now

Known Issues

    On Windows 7 32-bit, editor will not start Should be fixed in the next patch release.
    Editor hangs after pressing "Add new branch group" button within Tree Editor window in the Inspector (OSX). Should be fixed in a following patch release.
    Editor often crashes on Windows 10 when locking Windows, when using DirectX 9
    ETC1 compression format not playing well with Asset bundles generated with 5.2
    Legacy Animation: Changes to the lights in 5.3 have caused an issue so that it currently is not possible to animate lights using the Legacy animation system. We are aware of this and working on a fix. We will keep you all updated with the progress.
    Multiple displays do not report the correct resolution when using non-native resolutions, they report the screen resolution and not the game resolution. For Patch 1, the UI system has had multiple display support disabled on all platforms except WiiU and 3DS.
    Particle billboard shadows are not oriented correctly in 5.3, but should be fixed in 5.4
    Particle normals are different between versions 5.1 and 5.2. A fix will arrive in a patch release.

        Splash screen is tied to the "Show Unity Splash Screen" option and can be disabled in Unity Pro.
    WebGL: Add WebCamTexture support
    Windows Store: Added support for IL2CPP scripting backend

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes, see Upgrade Guide

    Graphics: Added custom near plane slider for spot light shadows instead of auto-calculation, defaults to 0.2. Scenes might need re-tuning.
    Graphics: Implemented shadow bias for point lights. Previously was not implemented, might need re-tuning.
    Physics: HingeJoints now have orientation to be compatible with Unity 4. The Rigidbody that share the GameObject with the HingeJoint will view the Joint anchor as a left-hand coordinate system. This means the Rigidbody will view positive angles as going clockwise around the Joint anchor. The HingeJoint "Connected Body" will view the Joint anchor as a right-hand coordinate system. This means the Connected Body will view positive angles as going counter-clockwise around the Joint anchor.
    Physics: Obsoleted enum JointDriveMode and JointDrive.mode
    Physics: When changing a mesh and subsequently setting it as the sharedMesh of a MeshCollider we now update collision mesh instead of ignoring the changes.
    Shaders: “Precompiled” shaders (e.g. pasting result from “show generated code” into shader asset itself) are not working anymore. This was deprecated before in Unity 5.2.
    Shaders: Smoothness curve of Standard shader matches Substance Painter and Marmoset Toolbag2 (only when tools are using GGX) very closely now. Your smoothness textures might need an update.
    Shaders: To improve visual quality of specular highlight Standard shader is now using GGX distribution function. Previously Blinn-Phong was used.
    VR: Oculus 0.8 Runtime required for Windows.

Change

    Android: Remove "Hide status bar" option in the Player Settings, now it is always hidden
    Animation: Removed unsupported "Resample Rotation" options when importing animations in Legacy Mode
    Deprecated: EditorApplication classNewScene,NewEmptyScene,OpenScene,OpenSceneAdditive, SaveScene,SaveCurrentSceneIfUserWantsTo,SaveCurrentSceneIfUserWantsToForce,currentScene,MarkSceneDirty,isSceneDirty and Application class levelCount,LoadLevel,LoadLevelAsync,LoadLevelAdditive,LoadLevelAdditiveAsync,loadedLevel, loadedLevelName APIs. They all redirect to equivalent APIs on EditorSceneManager or SceneManager but it is recommended to start using the new APIs instead.
    Editor: Don't show disabled context button for assets without a context menu
    Editor: EditorGUIUtility.RenderGameViewCameras() marked obsolete. It was poorly designed API, and it appears nobody uses it anyway. We'll give it at least one minor release until we remove it entirely, in order to see if anyone is actually using it.
    Editor: Screen.lockCursor will not be reset when clicking with mouse
    Graphics: OpenGL core (3.2 - 4.1) API is used by default on Mac OS X and Linux now.
    iOS: Use launch screens as primary source for splash images
    Particles: Enable dynamic collisions checkbox by default
    Particles: Setting playOnAwake through script will now change all systems that are part of the emitter, matches the inspectors behaviour.
    Physics: 2D physics (Box2D) now reports out-of-memory errors rather than simply crashing.
    Physics: Added PlatformEffector2D.sideArc to replace PlatformEffector2D.sideAngleVariance as well as adding the missing gizmo for sides
    Physics: Allow the PhysX CharacterController to consider the slope limit for Rigidbodies. This fixes bugs where the CharacterController could climb on very steep slopes on Rigidbodies. Restores Unity4 behavior.
    Physics: Restore the Rigidbody2D linear-velocity after a Rigidbody2D.MovePosition has completed.
    Physics: Setting Rigidbody.detectCollisions to false also affects queries now (e.g. Physics.RaycastAll)
    Terrain: "SplatCount" tag is removed from terrain shaders as it doesn't serve any purpose..
    UI: Updated function names to be more consistent with other classes
    Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8: Removed support for Windows Phone 8.0 and Windows Store Apps 8.0
    Windows Store Apps: Removed AppCallbacks.SetSwapChainBackgroundPanel function
    Windows Store: all managed plugins and WinMD files always target AnyCPU architecture. This essentially means that you no longer need to have separate wrapper DLL and winmd files for each native plugin you have.

Improvement

    2D: Clamp sprite pivot values (-100k..100k) instead of accepting any value (including infinity), previously clamped from (0..1)
    Add convenience methods to Dropdown for adding or clearing the options.
    Added a new property to control the width of the caret in UI.InputField.
    Added a new property to FontData to control whether horizontal alignment is done by glyph metrics or actual geometry.
    Added a ReadOnly property to UI.InputField
    Added buildProgress property to Lightmapping.
    Android: Optimized Standard Shader performance for OpenGL ES 2.0 devices
    Android: WWW - report HTTP status and response in case of failure
    API Updater: Report read only scripts instead of silently failing

    Expose the error tolerance on SpringJoint. This allows the springs to have a rest length shorter than the default 2.5 cm.
    Exposed all particle module parameters to script
    FrameDebugger: You can now see shader properties when you click on the draw call.
    GetComponentsInChildren now correctly works if one of the parents of the gameobject being called on is inactive. This makes GetComponentInChildren work on prefabs, and only changes behaviour in cases where previously you were guaranteed to get an empty array as result.

    GI: Greatly improved precompute performance (and bake as a side effect)! Clustering and light transport stages of the precompute are now considerably faster thanks to the upgrade to Enlighten 3.02. The entire precompute became 1.5-2 times faster. The precompute is currently a part of the bake, so bakes got faster too. description

    GI: Increase maximum allowed GI cache size.
    GI: Move Atlas Size to Baked GI section in Lighting window.
    GI: Renamed LightmapSnapshot to LightingDataAsset
    Graphics: Added Mesh.GetUVs with overloads for List, List, List

    Graphics: Fixed OpenGL ES on desktop support: correctly fetch normal and specular maps
    Graphics: More detailed breakdown of forward rendering pipeline in Profiler.
    Graphics: Reflection cubemap convolution is GGX now.
    Graphics: Reflection cubemap convolution preserves HDR highlights better.
    Graphics: Various dynamic geometry systems (Particles, Sprites, Lines, Trails, Flares, Halos) use multi-threaded "geometry job" system. Yay more multi-threading!
    Horizontal text alignment now uses the actual glyph geometry extents (rather than character advance) greatly improving the visual appearance of right alignment.
    Imported fonts now match any other font with the same family name as implicit fallbacks. This allows multiple styles to be used with a single font and the text generator will automatically use the appropriate face.
    Improved "The referenced script on this Behaviour" message with the game object name in the player, it will look now like 'The referenced script on this Behaviour (Game Object 'Main Camera') is missing!'.
    Input: Added Input.backButtonLeavesApp, usable on Windows Store Apps/Windows Phone 8.1 and Android, see docs for more info
    InputField no longer dirties the UI batch for the caret blink cycle when the caret is not visible.
    Integrated the industry standard for tangent space "mikktspace" into Unity. This allows artists to get seamless lighting since compatibility is ensured between normal map baker and renderer (particular xNormal and several other bakers).
    iOS: Added frameworks new in iOS 8.0 to 9.0 to the plugin importer UI.
    iOS: Added support for iPad launch screens
    MacOSX editor: The graphics API used by the editor is included in the editor title bar just like on Windows
    Mecanim: Additive Layer improvement. You can now specify the reference pose for your additive animation clip. The additive reference pose can be defined in either the model importer when you import your clip or with a new API function AnimationUtility.SetAdditiveReferencePose()
    MonoDevelop: Added missing documentation tool-tips for methods with optional/default arguments. Removed markup from documentation tool-tips.
    MonoDevelop: Updated to version 5.9.6.

    Particles: Simplifying Inherit Velocity UI, to remove duplicated functionality
    Physics: Added 'OneWayGrouping' property to PlatformEffector2D to group contacts.
    Physics: All new icons for all 2D physics types.
    Physics: Always render the outline of a PolygonCollider2D in dark-green so that if an edge is discarded, it still shows.
    Physics: Decouple centre of mass from inertia tensor. From now on, setting a custom centre of mass won't mark the inertia tensor as set explicitly as well. By analogy, setting inertia tensor won't have an instant effect on the centre of mass. Exposed two new API functions to reset the centre of mass and inertia tensor back to the automatically computed values. See also: Rigidbody.ResetCenterOfMass(),Rigidbody.ResetInertiaTensor(),Rigidbody.centerOfMass, Rigidbody.inertiaTensor, Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation.
    Pointer selection across multiple lines in UI.InputField is improved.
    Reflection Probes: Ability to turn off deferred reflections when using deferred shading. When "no support" is picked for deferred reflections in Graphics Settings, then in deferred shading reflection probes are done Unity 5.0/5.1 style (per-object).
    Reflection Probes: blurriness of glossy reflections from Realtime Reflection Probes matches Baked probes better now
    Scripting: Added CustomYieldInstruction class for implementing custom yield instructions
    Scripting: Added Matrix4x4.determinant property.
    Scripting: Added WaitWhile and WaitUntil yield instructions.
    Select All keyboard command now works for UI.InputField in Editor mode.
    Shaders: Improved shader storage and loading. This will decrease on-disk size of shaders in player builds, as well as making loading shaders faster and with a smaller memory spike.
    SpeedTree: Billboard batching performance is improved a bit.
    Text no longer clips the last line when only the leading would cause it to exceed the vertical bounds.
    TextGenerator now exposes the topY position of each line in UILineInfo.
    UI: Add caret color field to InputField as text color isn't always correct
    UI: Added force update method to InputField to allow instant recalculations
    UI: CanvasUpdateRegistry no longer checks for a element to be present twice
    UI: initial pooling of renderers will no longer iterate unnecessary elements
    UI: TouchInput module is no longer needed. Standalone is the only required module to get both touch and mouse/ keyboard events

    Windows Store Apps: LocationService will now start the first time it's Start() method is called with user consent being asked at that moment.
    Windows Store Apps: Unity now will overwrite files in VS solution, if they are not modified. A file UnityOverwrite.txt will be placed next to generated solution file, read it for more details.
    Windows Store: .NET Native will be disabled when doing Build And Run for Universal Windows 10 Apps, making the run faster
    Windows Store: Added user friendly message when trying to build to Windows Store Apps SDK 8.1, but SDK 8.1 is missing.

    MSE: Lightmap baking now work with multi-scene edit from the Lighting window UI. Simply opening multiple scenes, then pressing bake, will bake data for all open scenes at the same time. Lightmaps and Enlighten data is separated out into separate chunks / atlases per scene. At runtime it is loaded / unloaded separately from each other via the normal scene loading / unloading API's.
    MSE: Navmesh baking now work with multi-scene edit from the Navmesh window UI. Simply opening multiple scenes, then pressing bake, will bake data for all open scenes at the same time. Navmeshes will be baked and stored for all geometry together and the resulting navmesh is assigned to each scene.
