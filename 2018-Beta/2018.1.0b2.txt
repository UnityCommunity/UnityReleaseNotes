    Android: Added ARM64 (also known as AArch64) experimental support.

    Android: Added Sustained Performance Mode setting, which sets a predictable, consistent level of device performance over longer periods of time without thermal throttling. Based on the SustainedPerformance API from Google.

    Animation: Added PositionConstraint, RotationConstraint and ScaleConstraint components.

    Animation: Added the AimConstraint component.

    Animation: Added the ParentConstraint component.

    Animation: Added weighted tangent support to AnimationCurve.

    Build Pipeline: Added ability to store and retrieve object references by name through EditorBuildSettings.

    Build Pipeline: Added new BuildReport API. Building players and assetbundles will now return a BuildReport object that allows you to query information about the build process and outputs.

    Build Pipeline: Android Build & Run has now target device selection in the build dialog. It allows users to deploy to either a specific single device or to all supported devices simultaneously.

    Cache Server: Added -CacheServerIPAddress command line argument to connect Editor to specified Cache Server on startup.

    GI: Added experimental API for baking sky occlusion in Progressive Lightmapper. The sky occlusion value for a given input position denotes what fraction of the sky is visible for that point. It takes into account any lightmap static object. The sky occlusion allows you to apply the correct amount of sky lighting to objects that are otherwise hard to lightmap, such as trees and foliage.

    GI: [Experimental] Added new experimental C# interface to pass light information to the GI baking backends.

    Scripting: Added command line option "overrideMonoSearchPath" for desktop standalone players (OSX, Windows). "overrideMonoSearchPath" specifies an extra folder to search when Mono is loading assemblies. One intended use is two versions of the same project i.e. trial and full version. The assets are the same but the scripts are different. This command line option can be used to re-use the assets but load different scripts.

    Video: Audio sample output API for the VideoPlayer with support for access from C# or C++.

    Video: Support for reading videos from AssetBundles on Android.

    XR: Added a new option in the Windows MR Player Settings called Enable Depth Buffer Sharing. This allows the OS to better stabilize images without the need to manually set the focus plane. For more information on the benefits of image stabilization, see Microsoft's documentation on Hologram Stability.

    XR: Added support for capturing stereoscopic 360 images for VR and non-VR projects. Added omni-directional stereo (ODS) support in shader pipeline for rendering to 360 stereo cubemap.

    Editor: Plug-in code that creates textures used in rendering with IMGUI should now avoid specifying them in linear space (i.e. should set the linear parameter to false in the Texture2D constructor). Otherwise, GUI elements drawn with such textures may look washed out when the project is working in Linear space (Player Settings > Color space: Linear). (908904)

    Editor: Removed "intensity" float field next to HDR texture fields in material editors; instead use the exposure controls in the Color Picker.

    Graphics: Enabled instancing flexible array size for Vulkan.

    Graphics: Improved shader import handling when using #pragma target <version>. If no #pragma geometry, #pragma hull or #pragma domain statements are used to specify entrypoint functions, these shader features (geometry or tessellation) are now dropped from the internal shader capabilities requirement, allowing greater compatibility across non-DX11 graphics targets. In practise, this now allows using #pragma target 5.0 with Metal, as long as geometry shaders are not used.

    Graphics: In forward rendering do not fetch 2x2 white shadowmask texture when liting a realtime object with a mixed light using baked occlusion. (952761)

    Shaders: Added Windows support for shader include absolute paths longer than 260 characters.

    Shaders: Compute shaders are now included in the shader cache. E.g. tweaking a shader and then reverting the change will fetch the shader from the cache instead of recompilation.

    Shaders: Global shader properties are now visible to compute shaders. A global property value will be used if the property is not set locally for the compute shader.

    Shaders: Proper shader include dependency tracking implemented. Whenever a shader include file is modified all the dependent shaders - and nothing else - will get reimported. (646064, 916386, 957024)

    Shaders: Shader compilation speed improvement.

    Shaders: Surface Shaders with many multi_compile/shader_feature variants import several times faster now (internally that step has been multithreaded).

    Shaders: ComputeShader.Dispatch now validates if all the properties are valid.

    Shaders: SetPropertyBlock can now be used per material (in case of multi-material renderer), and can now use an optional material index.

    Windows: Multiple improvements in crash handling:
        Unity applications that enable the Performance Reporting Service will now receive Windows crash telemetry.
        Crash interception is now much more reliable, catching more categories of error, sooner and later in the application life.
        The crash UX for the player has been updated to remove the wordy English-only error message and display something generic before handing off to WER (which tells the user what happened in their native language).

    XR: Metal: Implemented the remaining draw call functionality (Graphics.DrawProcedural etc) for Single-Pass Stereo rendering, which was missing previously. (859819)
