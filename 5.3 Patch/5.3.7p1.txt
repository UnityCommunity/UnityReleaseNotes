    (807983) - Android: Fixed an issue whereby the projects without audio stopping the external audio sources.
    (824009) - Asset Bundles: Fixed the assetBundle property of AssetBundleCreateRequest so that it stalls instead of returning null when the bundle is not yet ready.

    (840596) - IL2CPP: A call to GetCurrentMethod in a generic method should return the generic method definition, not the inflated generic instance method.
    (845666) - IL2CPP: Fixed stacktraces on iOS when Link Time Optimization (LTO) was enabled in the build.
