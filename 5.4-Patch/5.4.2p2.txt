    (826047) - Animation: Fixed erroneous "Playable was not Disposed" being displayed.

    (807375) - Editor: Fixed the icon quality regression caused by unnecessary scaling step.
    (814484) - Editor: Improved performance of SetParent in deeply nested UI panels.
    (832292) - Graphics : Updated shader macros to support lod + sampler variations for texture cubes and arrays.
    (808298) - Graphics: Fixed a crash in CommandBuffer.DrawRenderer because of a NULL or inactive camera.
    (825082) - Graphics: Nullify RECT in case GetClientRect fails so we don't have trash in RECT.
    (840596) - IL2CPP: A call to GetCurrentMethod in a generic method should return the generic method definition, not the inflated generic instance method.

    (838259) - IL2CPP: Return an empty array from GetGenericArguments when it is called on a MethodInfo object from a non-generic method. Previously the runtime incorrectly threw an assert in this case.
    (820692) - iOS: Fixed a performance regression by resizing the constant pool adaptively on Metal.
    (820885) - iOS: Fix a race condition when changing resolution on startup on Metal.
    (820938) - iOS: Fix bug in retrieving of certain values of IScore larger than 32 bits.
    (808537) - iOS: GameCenterPlatform.ShowLeaderboardUI now shows the specific leaderboard when requested (note, the symptoms are still observable on iOS 8.4 and 9.x due to a bug in the OS itself).
    (801369) - iOS: ILeaderboard.LoadScores now does callback if SetUsersFilter is called.

    (837680) - Particles: Fixed an issue when rendering during OnPreRender using RenderWithShader.
    (819881) - Particles: Prevent restarting particle system when parent transform moves in the editor.
    (833737) - Physics 2D: Ensure that BoxCollider2D.Cast correctly detects a multi-edge EdgeCollider2D.
    (820300) - Physics 2D: Ensure that BoxCollider2D/PolygonCollider2D with large vertex but small area is created correctly.
    (830078, 819705) - Shaders: Fixed some cases of unsupported shader variants leading to a crash.
    (829326, 818524) - Trails: Fixed an occasional TrailRenderer crash when using Clear script API.
    (826310) - UI: Fixed an issue where the Disabled Trigger animation was triggered on hovering over a Button when this was not Interactable.
