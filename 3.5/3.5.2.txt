Improvements

    iOS: Added UnityGetGLView function to AppController.mm that returns the view that unity uses
    iOS: Splash now uses "retina" images if running on "retina" device
    Flash: Introduced System.Attribute base type so custom attributes can at least compile cleanly.
    Flash: It's now possible to invoke constructors that declare byref parameters.
    Flash: Slightly faster Stage3D path and faster path implemented for 11.1 and 11.2 specific deploys.
    Flash: Point filtering now works.
    Flash: System.Bitconverter now works.
    Flash: Dictionary.ContainsValue now works.
    Flash: Smaller memory footprint in some cases
    Flash: Speedup in SWFPostProcessing
    Flash: performance optimizations on generated bytecode.
    Flash: Byte[] now has a Flash native bytearray as a backing store (.elements).
    Flash: Shallow implementation of System.Text.Encoding for ascii and utf
    Flash: Implementations of System.Random, System.IO.MemoryStream, DateTime.Today
    Flash: System.Exception.StackTrace property.
    Flash: more conversion errors include related source location now.

Changes

    Added Resources.UnloadAsset(Object asset) function. This is useful for unloading large individual assets if you know they are no longer used and you don't want to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets().
    Editor: Introduced [Callbacks.PostProcessBuild] script attribute. It will execute the attributed method after the player has been built.
    Editor: Introduced [Callbacks.PostProcessScene] script attribute. It will execute the attributed method when the current scene has been processed.
    Flash: Has build targets for different FlashPlayer version 11.0, 11.1 and 11.2. No Flash Player version specific implementations exposed yet, but setting 11.2 means using a faster code path; better performance.
    Flash: www.GetAudioClip() now works, only for non streaming mp3's.
    Flash: WWW support
    Flash: WWWForm Support
    Flash: Assetbundle support

Fixes

    Android: Possible fix for random crashes in OpenGL ES driver on Galaxy Nexus ICS.
    Android: Touch problems related to ICS upgrades on some devices have been fixed.

    Editor: Catch more corner cases when detecting Visual Studio installations.
    Editor: Fixed out-of-memory crash when showing AudioClip's inspector while in play mode.

    Navmesh: NavMeshAgent fixed occasional invalid position/velocity when destination and position are set to the same vector.
    OS X: Fixed erratic mouse behavior with Microsoft mouse
    Windows Player: Fixed occasional hang in multithreaded renderer when going in and out of fullscreen mode.

Upgrade guide

    In Unity 3.4 realtime lights were not affecting static objects. In Unity 3.5 realtime lights always affect static and dynamic objects.

    The result of this is that if you had previously setup your lighting to work around this bug, then you will now get worse performance as you will receive the lighting twice. It will also look different since your lights will be added twice to the scene.

    The correct way to use these lights is to use a single auto directional light and remove the realtime only light.

    If you wish to have different realtime lighting than static lighting, you should using light culling masks to affect only dynamic objects.
