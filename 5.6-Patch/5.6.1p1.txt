Patch 5.6.1p1
Released: 18 May 2017

Improvements

    Added R8 and RG16 Texture formats, and RGBAUShort and RG16 Render Texture formats.
    Added support for the 5th generation iPad.
    Added a timeout property to UnityWebRequest. This gives coarse grain control over timeouts for webrequests.

    (873026) - GI: Fixed a crash when creating Reflection Probes from OnWillRenderObject.
    (none) - GI: Inverse squared falloff in progressive lightmapper.
    (815031) - GI: Fixed an issue where a certain combination of GI settings and multiple Scenes being additively loaded would make baked light maps vanish.
    (883844) - GI: Added support for negatively scaled Meshes in the progressive lightmapper. This now allows you to mirror Meshes using negative Transform values.
    (890651) - GI: Added support for quads in progressive lightmapper.
    (867797) - Graphics: Disabled directional shadows when Screen Space Shadows (Edit > Project Settings > Graphics) is set to No Support but Cascaded Shadows is enabled in the Tier Settings.

    (771031) - Graphics: Fixed a crash that occurred when Texture.GetPixels or Texture.SetPixels were used with invalid input parameters.
    (909607) - Graphics: Fixed clear artifacts appearing on Metal when only the UI camera was used in the Scene.

    (905659) - IL2CPP: Applied a fix to prevent the following exception occuring on some projects during runtime: 'NotSupportedException: IL2CPP encountered a managed type which it cannot convert ahead-of-time. The type uses generic or array types which are nested beyond the maximum depth which can be converted'.
    (none) - iOS: Fixed broken microphone permissions when camera is not used in app.
    (902650) - Metal: Fixed GPU hang on A7/A8 devices in some MSAA scenarios.
