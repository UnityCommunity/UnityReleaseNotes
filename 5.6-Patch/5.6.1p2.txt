    (none) - Multiplayer: Network simulator works again.
    (905335) - NavMesh: Fixed the tile carving algorithm so that it's capable of handling colinear degenerate triangles. This was causing the generated NavMesh to have a double line on polygon and was causing a trembling movement for its associated GameObject.
    (896001) - Particles: Fixed a crash on certain Android hardware caused by zero sized particles.
    (907407) - Physics: Do not show missing Effector2D warning in Collider2D inspector when the Collider2D is using a CompositeCollider2D.

    (792933) - Scene Management : Fixed an issue where objects marked as 'DoNotDestroyOnLoad' and are disabled could be deleted on scene load/unload
    (901719) - Shaders: Fixed an incorrect shader translation to GLSL and Metal shader code from a logical OR on boolean vectors. Fixed shader compile errors on Vulkan eg "Shader error in 'Hidden/Post FX/Screen Space Reflection': '' : compilation terminated at line 141 (on vulkan)".
    (none) - Shaders: Fixed an incorrect shader translation to GLSL and Metal shader code from unsigned divide operation.
    (891914) - Shaders: Prevent assert failures and crashes when attempting to compile tessellation or geometry shaders on platforms where they're not supported.
    (898850) - Shaders: Vulkan added support for vector scalar expansion constructors. Fixed crashes with errors like "SymGetSymFromAddr64 error: 'Attempt to access invalid address.'"

Known Issues

    (916838) - Transform handles are lit and hidden by light source - this will be fixed in one of the patches soon.
    (915659) - Crash building player if project has shaders with errors, this one regressed in this patch. This will be fixed in the next patch 5.6.1p3.
