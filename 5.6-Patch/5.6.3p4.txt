This was causing problems when, for example, an attempt was made to open a URL when launching FBlogin through the Unity Facebook SDK when in portrait only autorotate state.
    (944462) - iOS : Fixed an occasional crash on iOS when using UnityWebRequest.
    (945175) - OSX : Fix for memory leak in LocalFileSystemOSX::Enumerate when using AssetDatabase.CopyAsset.

    (916584) - Physics : Stop invalid warning being output to console when destroying a CompositeCollider2D component.
    (928582, 941997, 795258) - Profiler : Fixed memory leak when connection switched from player to editor.
    (942459) - Scripting : Fixed a crash when invalid IL code was encountered.
    (918046) - Scripting : Fixed a crash when Ldflda opcode was used and null check was missing.
    (763091) - Scripting : Fixed a crash if delegate was created on un-inflated generic type.
    (912607) - Scripting : Fixed debugger error of "Unable to step" when trying to step over dead code blocks.
    (931791, 936519) - Shaders : Addressed an internal issue that was causing the same shader to be built different as part of an AssetBundle on each successive build run. This only affected certain shaders and only occurred in macOS.
    (936801) - UnityWebRequest : Fixed a possible freeze on iOS, when running multiple UnityWebRequests with custom download handler scripts.
    (none) - UnityWebRequest : Fixed early availability of status code when UnityWebRequest was still running.
    (none) - UnityWebRequest : Ensure that headers are available in UnityWebRequest only after all of them are received.
