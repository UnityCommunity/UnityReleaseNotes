Release notes 5.4.1f1
Released 8 September 2016

Improvements

    Core: Added support for loading serialized files stored with versions >= 5.5.0a4.
    DX11: Improved texture upload performance for compressed, floating point and RGBA32 formats (also in 5.3.6p3) (812350).
    Graphics: GPU Instancing - it is no longer an error to use instanced shaders on renderers that don't support instancing (SkinnedMeshRenderer, SpriteRenderer, etc.).
    Graphics: GPU Instancing - for statically batched MeshRenderers, using an instanced shader now will not break static batching. If you want renderers to be instancing batched, please consider disable static batching flag (816786).
    Linux: Removed 16GB total memory limit.
    Networking: Projects using UnityWebRequest from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking should now be auto-upgraded to use its new location in UnityEngine.Networking.
    VR: Mac version of the editor can now add OpenVR as a VR platform when targeting the Windows player.
    VR: Stereo View and Projection Matrices can be set individually through scripting API.
    VR: Updated the following Image Effects from the Standard Assets to work with Single-Pass Stereo: Ambient Obscurance, Camera Motion Blur. (811571)
    VR: Upgraded SDKs - Oculus to 1.7, GearVR to 1.7.1, OpenVR to 1.0.2.
    Windows Store: Windows Extension SDK references will now be automatically added to Assembly-CSharp projects.

Fixes

Unity 5.4.1 also includes relevant fixes from 5.3.6 patch releases.

    AI: Fixed an issue where 'Not Walkable' objects close to the ground would not create a hole in the navmesh when baked. (820608)
    Android: Editor: Added a workaround for AAPT sometimes crashing for no good reason. (797965)
    Animation: Fixed a crash that happened when disabling a gameobject during animation-triggered physics callbacks. (813681)
    Animation: Fixed a crash inCreateAnimatorGenericBindings when attempting to use AnimationMixerPlayable on start of a game object. (820203)
    Animation: Fixed a crash when adding AnimationClip to an enabled Animation component whilst in play mode in the editor. (820586)
    Animation: Fixed additive layer using disabled "Resample Animation" blended with layers that have it enabled. (822897)
    Animation: Fixed an issue where an assert that couldn't be acted upon was popping in the AvatarMask inspector. (813105)
    Collab: Fixed a crash when opening a cloud project named with numbers if you already have a project named the same in your folder. (763383)
    DX11: Fixed editor spewing out "Failed to query D3D11 context for ID3DUserDefinedAnnotation interface" error message when run on Windows 7 machine without Windows updates installed. (819707)
    Editor: Fixed a bug that launching Editor window will exit after signed on windows. (816567)
    Editor: Fixed occasional freeze when profiling over network and connection is lost. (716213)
    Editor: Fixed the inspector UI for some Renderers where Light Probe and Reflection Probe options were not displayed correctly.
    Fixed performance regression of LightProbes.GetInterpolatedProbe API.   GI:
    GI: Fixed a crash in Reflection Probe component when multiple scenes are used. (811241)
    GI: LightProbes.GetInterpolatedProbe will return a black probe now if there are no light probes in the scene. (815127)
    GI: Multi-scene editor. Fixed the lightmap indices not updating for additively loaded scenes in the Editor. (745588)
    Graphics: Fixed a crash when running with Graphics Jobs caused by one thread unloading mesh data whilst another thread is using the data.  
    Graphics: Fixed ForwardAdd pass z-fighting issue when the object is rendered with GPU instancing, for example when you have multiple lights (819088).
    Surface shaders are automatically updated to apply the fix.
    For custom vert/frag shaders, instead of using the macro "UNITY_USE_CONCATENATED_MATRICES", now please use the new "#pragma force_concat_matrix" directive in the ForwardAdd pass.  
    Graphics: Fixed image effects being rendered twice when the camera is instantiated from prefab or copying another camera. This issue was in player builds only. (814402, 811236)

    Particles: Fixed an issue where the first vertex of a trail renderer could be missing. (823495)
    Particles: Fixed particle system random seed regression. (782232)
    Profiler: Fixed GPU profiling showing "N/A" for most draw calls, instead of associating with proper objects. (772640, 817337)
    Tizen: Added a method to request the Evas_GL object to possibly be used in plugins.  
    Tizen: Added API compatibility control. Currently only 2.3 and 2.4 are supported.

    Tizen: Support multiple sensor listener.  
    UnityWebRequest: Fixed errors in console when downloading texture. (813763)
