5.4.0f3 Release Notes (FULL)
Release Date 28 July 2016 

Features

Editor: Optional "strict mode" when building projects and AssetBundles, which will fail the build if any errors (even non-fatal ones) are reported during the build process.
GI: Added de-noising filter to baked final gather. description
GI: Light Probe Proxy Volumes
    This component allows using more than one light probe sample for large dynamic objects (think large particle systems or important characters). It will sample probes into a 3D texture and use that in the shader.
    Requires shader model 4+ platform (DX11/DX12 on Windows, GLCore 4.1+ on Mac/Linux, PS4, XboxOne). description
Graphics: GPU Instancing Support
    Use GPU instancing to draw a large amount of identical geometries with very few draw calls.
    Works with MeshRenderers that use the same material and the same mesh.
    Only needs a few changes to your shader to enable it for instancing. Supports custom vertex/fragment shader and surface shaders.
    Set per-instance shader properties from script via MaterialPropertyBlock.
    Supports Graphics.DrawMesh command.
    Requires shader model 4+ platform (DX11/DX12 on Windows, GLCore 4.1+ on Mac/Linux, PS4, XboxOne). description
Graphics: Improved multithreaded rendering:
    Compared to current dual-thread rendering (main thread + rendering thread), this splits up rendering logic into concurrent "graphics jobs" that run on all available CPU cores.
    See "Graphics Jobs" option in player settings (off by default, still considered experimental).
    Currently implemented on PC (Win/Mac/Linux/WindowsStore), PS4, XboxOne. Best results with modern graphics APIs like DX12.
    In addition to multithreaded rendering, overall CPU graphics performance should be better in 5.4. description
Graphics: Motion vector rendering support
    Motion vectors track the screen space position of an object from one frame to the next, and can be used for post process effects.
    See the API docs for Renderer.motionVectors, Camera.depthTextureMode, SkinnedMeshRenderer.skinnedMotionVectors, PassType.MotionVectors, and DepthTextureMode.MotionVector.
    Requires RGHalf render texture format support.
    Utilized in the current beta of Unity Cinematic Image Effects descriptiondescription
    See Keijiro Takahashi's example of vector field visualization KinoVision
    description
Graphics: Texture Array support
    SeeTexture2DArray class.
    Requires shader model 3.5+ platform (DX11/DX12 on Windows, GLCore Mac/Linux, GLES3+, Metal, PS4, XboxOne).
    Here they are used in the Adam demo for terrain shading: description
IAP: Cloud catalog
    A 'useCloudCatalog' boolean has been added to UnityEngine.Purchasing.ConfigurationBuilder. When set, Unity IAP will fetch your catalog of products for sale from the Unity cloud. Catalog is configured via the Unity Analytics dashboard.
IL2CPP: Android support for IL2CPP is now official (previously 'experimental').
iOS: Added support for ODR (On Demand Resources) initial install tags.
Kernel: The Transform component has been rewritten using SIMD and a cache-friendly data layout, so the code is now faster for many use cases.
OSX: Unity Editor supports Mac Retina displays now (mostly for improved text and icon rendering). Windows HiDPI support in development. description
Particles: New Trigger Module, including:
    A script callback when particles touch a predefined list of collision shapes.
    Ability to modify/kill particles that are intersecting the collision shapes.
    Editor UI: description Example: description
Particles: Particle width, height and depth (for Mesh particles) can now be defined independently from each other. Editor UI: description
description Example: description
Physics: Various physics improvements:
    Overlap recovery. Used to de-penetrate CharacterControllers from static objects when an overlap is detected. When activated, the CharacterController will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move to a safe place where it does not overlap other objects.
    Added ContactPoint.separation API.
    Added Physics.OverlapCapsule and OverlapCapsuleNonAlloc functions.
    Added Rigidbody.solverVelocityIterations and Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations, to help stabilize bounce behavior on impacts.
Services: GamePerf service integration. You can now track your exceptions from the wild by enabling this in the Services window.
Shaders: ComputeShader improvements:
    Added DispatchIndirect function. Similar to DrawProceduralIndirect; dispatches ComputeShader with parameters sourced from ComputeBuffer.
    API of counters on ComputeBuffers can now be optionally reset when bound, and can be explicitly set via SetCounterValue.
    Exposed ComputeShader.GetKernelThreadGroupSizes to query Compute thread group sizes.
    Improved error handling for ComputeShaders.
    Debugging via #pragma enable_d3d11_debug_symbols, just like for regular shaders.
Shaders: Uniform array support
    Uniform arrays can be set by new array APIs on MaterialPropertyBlock, Shader and Material.
    Supports array sizes up to 1023.
    The old way of setting array elements by using number-suffixed names is removed.
Substance: ProceduralMaterials are now supported at runtime on Windows Store/Phone platforms.
VR: Multi-device support
    PlayerSettings: When the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox is checked, a prioritized list is shown allowing devs to choose which VR SDKs their game supports. (Similar to the Graphics API selection dialog)
    VR SDK list is per build-target.
    Dependencies (such as DLLs) will be copied to the build for every SDK in the list.
    At startup, Unity will go down the list and try to initialize each device. If any fail to initialize (for example, if the headset is not connected), Unity will move on to the next. If all fail, Unity won’t enter VR mode.
    PlayerSettings: Deprecated PlayerSettings stereoscopic 3D checkbox. This goes through the same subsystem as the VR devices, so a non-headmounted stereoscopic driver is one of the possible devices on supporting platforms.
    API: Deprecated VRDeviceType enum and VRSettings.loadedDevice. This is replaced with VRSettings.loadedDeviceName and VRSettings.LoadDeviceByName().
    API: Added the ability to get a list of supported SDKs. Readonly: string[] VRSettings.supportedDevices.
VR: Native OpenVR support
    Note that native OpenVR support renders with an off-center asymmetric projection matrix. This means that any shaders which relied on fov / aspect may not work correctly.
VR: Native Spatializer Plugins for VR
    Oculus Spatializer included with the support.
VR: Oculus Support for DirectX 12.
VR: Optimized Single-Pass Stereo Rendering
    Instead of rendering each eye separately, this uses a wider render target and alternating draw calls to render both eyes with a single scene traversal.
    Option in Player Settings.
    Note that some image effects or screenspace shaders might need to be updated to work with it. description
Windows: Added speech recognition APIs under UnityEngine.Windows.Speech. These APIs are supported on all Windows platforms as long as they're running on Windows 10 (editor, standalone, store apps).
Windows: Added support for G-Sync and FreeSync on Windows 10 on DirectX 11 (for the Windows Store player only) and DirectX 12 (for both the standalone player and the Windows Store player).
Windows Store: Realtime global illumination now works when using Windows 10 SDK.

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

Android: WebCam no longer works on Gingerbread devices.
DX12: Introduced new native plugin interface IUnityGraphicsD3D12v2 . The old interface will not function anymore due to differences in internal graphics job submission.
Editor: Deprecated UnityEditor.ShaderUtil.ShaderPropertyTexDim; users should now use Texture.dimension.
GI: Deprecated Light.actuallyLightmapped; users should now use Light.isBaked and Light.bakedIndex instead. Baked Light now has unique index, instead of the flag "actuallyLightmapped"
Graphics: Deprecated Material(String) constructor further. This will now always create a material with the error shader and print an error, in both Editor and player. It will be completely removed in a future Unity version.
Physics: Made changes to avoid Physics transform drift by not sending redundant Transform updates.
Physics: Physics Meshes are now rejected if they contain invalid (non-finite) vertices.
Playables: Refactored API so that Playables are structs instead of classes, making the API allocation-less in C#.
Scripting: Added two new script errors in the editor for catching calls to the Unity API during serialization. See "Scripting Serialization" page in the manual for more details.
Scripting: Promoted WebRequest interface from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking to UnityEngine.Networking. Unity 5.2 and 5.3 projects that use UnityWebRequest will need to be updated.
Shaders: Changed default shader compilation target to "#pragma target 2.5" (SM3.0 on DX9, DX11 9.3 feature level on WinPhone). Can still target DX9 SM2.0 and DX11 9.1 feature level with "#pragma target 2.0". The majority of built-in shaders target now 2.5. Notable exceptions are Unlit, VertexLit and fixed function shaders.

Changes

Android: Assets - Disabled texture streaming for Android.
Android: Deprecated UnityPlayerNativeActivity and UnityPlayerProxyActivity; these will now print warnings to the logcat if in use.

Scripting: Using GameObject.AddComponent<MonoBehaviour> is no longer allowed and will throw an exception. Derive a class from MonoBehaviour and add it instead.
Shaders: Moved internal shader for computing screenspace cascaded shadows into Graphics Settings. If you were overriding it before by just dropping it into the project, you now need the custom one via Graphics Settings.
Shaders: Removed support for EXT_shadow_samplers on non-iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 platform.
Terrain: Terrain objects created in the Scene will now be properly renamed (in the same way as GameObjects) to avoid using the same name.
Terrain: When different TerrainData are used for Terrain and TerrainCollider components on the same GameObject, a warning message will be shown with a button to fix the situation.
UI: Switched component menu name for RectMask2D to match class name.
UI: UI no longer interacts with the cursor when the cursor is locked.

Known Issues

[814953] Audio: Memory tracking of AudioClip Assets is broken. Clips referenced by the Scene or loaded in background will be tracked under AudioManager instead of the respective clips. This is the temporary trade-off to fix a crash from a threading race condition. A fix is in progress.
[817337] Editor: The GPU profiler does not associate draw calls with objects, and displays "N/A" for most of them. A fix is being tested and is due in patch release.
[802273] Editor: GPU Profiler does not work with 'Graphics Jobs' enabled. A fix is in progress.
[804333] Editor: Reverting prefab and pressing undo can result in a crash.
[808187] Editor: Undoing hierarchy leads to m_TransformData.hierarchy == NULL assert followed by a crash.
[813805] Graphics: GPU skinning crashes some DX11 drivers when shaders with tessellation were rendering just before it. A fix is being tested and is due in a patch release.
[809364] UI: 9-Sliced images whose sprite has mipmapping can blur if size is too small. Disable mipmapping as workaround.
[817835] VR: Changing the renderViewport scale results in render texture not scaling correctly on HMD when using single-pass stereo.

To be addressed separately from 5.4.x

[688985] GI: Copying a Scene loses the baked lighting. Workaround is to manually use "Build Lighting.". This will not be addressed in 5.4.
Graphics: In deferred rendering, lightmapped objects affected by mixed-mode lights fallback to forward rendering.
[762371] Scene Management: SceneManager.UnloadScene hangs if called from a physics trigger. Workaround is to defer unload. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
[779516] UI: Editing Text with Best Fit enabled causes artifacts to appear. This will not be addressed in 5.4.
VR: In-development cinematic Image Effects (Bitbucket project) do not currently work with single-pass rendering. This will be addressed independently of the 5.4 release schedule.
[799533] VR: SteamVR does yet not support DX12. This will be coordinated between SteamVR's schedule and Unity's, but it is currently unclear which cycle this will be part of.
[807031] VR: SteamVR Unity Native: When you have two "eye" Cameras under head, Unity crashes. Working with Valve to address in the plugin. This will be addressed on SteamVR's schedule.
[776787] Windows Store: Unity APIs which take multi-dimensional arrays as parameters (e.g. TerrainData.SetHeights) do not work on UWP in configurations (e.g. Master config) in which .NET Native compilation is enabled. The bug has been logged with Microsoft.
