Release notes
2017.1.0f3 Release Notes (Full, diff from f2 at end)
Known Issues

    Audio: On Windows, AudioSource attached to VideoPlayer produces choppy sound when game iterations are overrunning. Will be fixed in future Unity release. (895458)
    GI: Lit clustering debug visualization does not show (to be fixed in patch) (911953)
    xR: Rendering problems on Pixel Daydream when using 4x or 8x MSAA with single-pass stereo. This is due to driver issues, so the problem will be addressed via a driver update, independently of Unity releases.

Features

    2D: Added Sprite Physics Shape to Sprite Editor, to allow users to set a custom default shape for a Sprite for generating collider shapes with a PolygonCollider2D.
    2D: Introduced 2D Sprite Atlas, a new asset that will supplant the Sprite Packer. With it comes new and improved workflows that gives the developer more control on how to pack sprites and use them at runtime. description
    2D: Sprite Mask. Mask Sprites in world space using the new SpriteMask component. description
    Animation: Manual Keyframing Workflow. Separate Recording and Preview modes in the Animation Window. Contextual menus added to all animatable properties in the inspector.
    Animation: New GameObjectRecorder in UnityEditor.Experimental.Animations description
    Audio: Added support for ambisonic audio clips and ambisonic decoder plugins.
    Audio: Timeline Editor Audio Track support. Audio clips are now enabled in Timeline, using a scheduling API.
    Build Pipeline: The Asset Bundle Browser comes out of beta with Unity 2017.1. This tool enables the user to view and edit the configuration of Asset Bundles for their Unity project. It is intended to replace the current workflow of selecting assets and setting their Asset Bundle manually in the inspector. description
    Collab: In-Progress. In-Progress allows developers using Unity Collaborate to see who else on their team has made local changes to a Scene or Prefab before those changes have been published. description
    Editor: Added new ArcHandle class in UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls to interactively edit arcs in the Scene View. description
    Editor: Experimental feature : retained-mode UI system for the Editor (UI Elements)
    GI: Added support for baked LODs in Progressive Lightmapper
    GI: Support for double sided materials in Progressive Lightmapper. Added a new material setting that causes lighting to interact with backfaces. When enabled, both sides of the geometry get accounted for when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces do not count as invalid when seen from other objects. Backface rendering is not controlled by this setting nor will backfaces be represented in the lightmaps. Backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces.
    Graphics: Added Custom Render Texture asset. A Custom Render Texture is a new type of Render Texture that can be easily updated with a shader. It provides a user interface and a scripting framework. description
    Graphics: Added LineUtility class and 'LineRenderer.Simplify' function. Optimize your lines and curves by using the LineUtility to create a simplified version with a similar shape.
    Graphics: Added partial update/readback of compute buffers
    Graphics: The latest version of the Post-processing stack is available in beta. This new version offers improved effects and a complete framework for custom effects. It also comes with a volume-based blending feature, so you can define areas in the scene and set up specific looks when the player enters them. Unity will automatically blend between volumes to allow for smooth look transitions. Final release is expected this summer.
    Graphics: Updated Splash screen logo and style
    IMGUI: Added SearchField, a new IMGUI Control. It comes with Normal and Toolbar UI styles but can also be customized.
    Input: Added new Player Settings property 'Input Manager' for enabling backend of new input system preview feature. The front-end is supplied separately and is not included with the release.
    iOS: Enable deferred shading rendering path for Metal and OpenGL ES 3.0 for A8 and later iOS devices.
    Particles: Added support for using Sprites in the Particle System, via the Texture Sheet Animation Module description
    Particles: Apply Noise Module data to particles sizes and rotations, and also send the noise data to your shaders via new Custom Vertex Streams. description description
    Particles: New Donut emission shape. description
    Playables: Playable Assets added to Playable API.
    Playables: Playable Director added to play Playable Assets
    Playables: Timeline Editor and Runtime API. A tool for sequencing animation, scripts and audio. description
    Scripting: Experimental support for new scripting runtime. This includes Mono 4.8 and IL2CPP with support for C# 6 and .NET 4.6 description
    Shaders: Added support for "inline" sampler states.
        HLSL SamplerState objects that aren't taking sampling state from any texture (like what "sampler"+TextureName samplers do), but where sampling state is instead derived from the name.
        For example, "MyLinearClampSampler" sets up bilinear filtering and clamp wrap mode; while "point_repeat_sampler" sets up point filtering and repeat wrap mode.
        This allows e.g. doing both PCF depth comparison and reading raw depth value from a shadow map in a single shader.
        Note that generally only modern graphics APIs support separate textures & samplers. You might therefore want to specify #pragma target 3.5 or similar in your shaders for this.
        Implemented on DX11, DX12, PS4, XB1, Metal (Vulkan not yet).
    Windows: Multi-display support for UWP.

    Build Pipeline: Added delegates to BuildPlayerWindow that allow overriding the default Build button behavior
    Build Pipeline: Scripts-only build is now available on all platforms.
    Build Pipeline: Unified assembly stripping code used for IL2CPP and Mono builds - which should result in more consistent behaviour between IL2CPP and Mono and in smaller build sizes for platforms supporting assembly stripping on Mono.

    iOS: Added API to change iOS splashscreens.
    iOS: iOSStatusBarStyle.BlackOpaque and iOSStatusBarStyle.BlackTranslucent are obsolute use iOSStatusBarStyle.LightContent instead (894136)
    Light modes: Added QualitySettings.shadowmaskMode
    Physics: Added 'Joint2D.attachedRigidbody' property to retrieve the Rigidbody2D attached to the Joint2D.
    Physics: Exposed Joint.massScale & Joint.connectedMassScale. This allows adjusting masses and inertia tensors of the connected bodies as perceived by the solver. It's mostly useful for ragdolls that have high forces applied to their limbs and thus experiencing unpleasant stretchiness. This should also help avoiding setting the same mass for all the body parts of a ragdoll, as recommended before. See more in the API docs.
    Playables: - Changed C# Playable classes to structures: new and better approach for the API, it uses less memory and is in line with the future job system.
        Remove properties in favor of getters and setters: since we're using class extensions that can't have properties, we decided to only use methods to have a consistant API (i.e. not properties there and methods here just because reasons).
        Rename ScriptPlayableData to PlayableBehaviour: the PlayableBehaviour is the user side of the ScriptPlayable, it is where the user puts its logic.
        Documentation is in progress expect a better one in a few weeks.
    Playables: Moved Playable out of Experimental namespace.
    Playables: New method PlayableGraph.IsPlaying()
    Playables: Renamed PlayableGraph.Connect() parameters for clarity
    Scripting: Add serialization support for unsafe fixed size buffers. See SerializedProperty.GetFixedBufferElementAtIndex docs for example code.
    Scripting: Made GameObject.CalculateBounds() internal after it was accidentally made public in the 2017.1 beta cycle. This API is in the wrong place and will be moved/removed entirely in a future release
    Scripting: Rename to Debug.logger to Debug.unityLogger (852000)
    UI: Change isPaused to isFocused to better represent what it is. Only Effects 2017.1 betas
    Web: (Also mentioned under Changes/Improvements) UnityWebRequest now has built-in support for downloading MovieTexture on platforms that do support it. A new helper class WebRequestMultimedia has been introduced for simple download of MovieTexture or AudioClip. WebRequest.GetAudioClip() has been deprecated in favor of WebRequestMultimedia.GetAudioClip().
    Web: A new UnityWebRequest.timeout property that gives the user some coarse-grain control over the time a webrequest can take before unity attempts to cancel it.
    Web: Added timeout property to UnityWebRequest. (823903)
    Web: Moved UnityWebRequest.GetTexture() to UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture().
