Unity 2017.1.2f1


Release notes
Improvements

    2D: Sprite atlas packing will now spend less time reconciling sprite from cache atlas. Previously this was slow, especially in a new editor session.
    Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, this resolution won't be clamped as usual, allowing to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.
    iOS: Added an Marketing icon kind for iOS and a slot for a 1024x1024 App Store icon.
    Tizen: Load the first scene during displaying Splash screen.

Changes

    2D: Sprite atlas packing will now cancel and return an error if there exist sprite(s) with size larger than the pre-determined atlas max size.
