Unity 2017.3.0f1 release notes
2017.3.0f1 Release Notes (diff since 2017.3.0b11)
Known Issues in 2017.3.0f1

    Android: Gradle builds fail when there are more than 250 files in streamingAssets. As a workaround, you can use a custom file extension for the files you want uncompressed. Specify this extension in a custom Gradle mainTemplate under "noCompress". You should also remove "STREAMING_ASSETS" from the template to avoid hitting the file limit. (962451)

    Universal Windows Platform: [WSA]Unity throws a System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException error when exporting to the WSA player (UWP/.NET Backend) with a Project folder that has a long path. (959984)

2017.3.0f1 Release Notes (Full)
Features

    Analytics: Added support to capture VR device refresh rate, dimension, aspect ratio, HMD tracking and Controllers tracking as part of device info and device status events.

    Animation: Added support for integer and enum animation.

    Asset Pipeline: Added AssetDatabase.ForceReserializeAssets API. This method allows you to proactively load, upgrade, and write back to disk any Asset or Scene files in the project. When project upgrades cause serialization changes to Assets and metafiles, Unity writes these changes to disk separately from regular development iterations.

    Editor: Added assembly definition files for script compilation pipeline in the editor. This allows you to define your own managed assemblies based on scripts inside a folder. Splitting your project's scripts into multiple assemblies can greatly reduce script compilation times in the Editor. Note that the latest version of Visual Studio Tools for Unity is required for this feature to work with solution and project generation for Visual Studio.

    Editor: Added events: MouseEnter, MouseLeave, MouseOver, MouseOut, AttachToPanel, DetachFromPanel, PostLayout.

    Editor: Added Focus events that notify UIElements when they gain or lose focus (the focused element receives keyboard input), and a focus ring, which is a circular list of UIElements that gives the order in which they receive the focus when you press Tab or Shift+Tab.

    Editor: Added the Transform Tool, a single Gizmo you can use to move, rotate and scale in the Unity Editor.

    Editor: You can now use DX12 API in the Editor.

    Facebook: Segmented the uploader for the Facebook platform.

    GI: Added support for HDR compressed lightmaps (BC6H) on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. To enable this, go to Player Settings and set the Lightmap Encoding option to High Quality.

    Graphics: Added a new method, ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture. Use this to save screenshots taken with ScreenCapture as Textures in the Editor.

    Graphics: Added Crunch compression support for ETC_RGB4 and ETC2_RGBA8 textures. Improved compression ratio and speed for DXT Crunch.

    Graphics: Added Dynamic Resolution as an engine feature, debuting on Xbox One platform.

    Graphics: Added support for multisampled Textures in Shaders. To use a multi-sampled Texture in a Shader, declare it as Texture2DMS<float4> (or, for example, float for a single-channel texture), and then sample as described in Microsoft's documentation on Texture2DMS::Load methods. You must create the corresponding RenderTexture with the bindMS flag set on the RenderTextureDescriptor, or set the bindTextureMS flag after creation on the RenderTexture itself.

    Graphics: Support for 32 bit Mesh index buffers:
        By default, meshes larger than 65k vertices get imported with a 32 bit index buffer. Smaller meshes still use 16 bit indices.
        Added Index Format setting to Mesh Importer to override this behavior.
        Added Mesh.indexFormat to scripting API for Meshes created at run time.

    Kernel: Added new argument -systemallocator. This disables Engine management of allocations, and instead uses system allocations. This is useful when using external tools for memory debugging.

    Particles: Added a new Speed Modifier option in the Particle System Velocity Module. Use this to control particle speeds without changing their directions.

    Particles: Added Unlit and Surface shaders for use with Particle Systems.

    Particles: Ribbonized Particle Trails.

    Physics: Exposed a new broadphase algorithm called called Multi-Box Pruning, which is based on subdividing the world boundaries. This helps to overcome the performance issues in the standard sweep-and-prune approach, by exluding the excess checks of bodies that are far away but overlap each other along one of the principal axes. Access Multi-Box Pruning in the Unity Editor's Physics Settings.

    Physics: Exposed new settings in the Physics Manager: Contacts Generation, Contact Pairs, and Broadphase Type. This allows receiving the collision and trigger events from kinematic-kinematic and kinematic-static contact pairs.

    Physics: Exposed MeshCollider.cookingOptions. Cooking options allow you to enable or disable certain features in Mesh cooking (the process of turning a normal Mesh into a Mesh that is suitable for use in the physics system). These options can help you achieve a much shorter cooking time. This API requires that you manually check the input data for validity.

    Playables: Added new delay feature for IPlayables.

    Playables: Added new Video Playables Integration.

    Profiler: Added API for custom threads profiling: Profiling.BeginThreadProfiling, and Profiling.EndThreadProfiling.

    Scripting: Added command line option "overrideMonoSearchPath" for desktop standalone players (OSX, Windows). "overrideMonoSearchPath" specifies an extra folder to search when Mono is loading assemblies. One intended use is to have two versions of the same project (such as a trial version and a full version). The Assets are the same, but the scripts are different. You can use this command line option to re-use the Assets, but load different scripts.

    Scripting: Added Mono/.NET 2.0 support for Memory Profiler. See more on GitHub.

    Services: Performance Reporting Service: Added support for MacOS native crashes.

    Video: Added panoramic 360/180 2D/3D video workflows.

    Video: Introduced UnityEngine.Media.MediaEncoder to expose the VideoClipImporter encoders. This allows you to create movie files via script.

    XR: Added a new option in the Windows MR Player Settings called Enable Depth Buffer Sharing. This allows the OS to better stabilize images without the need to manually set the focus plane. For more information about the benefits of image stabilization, see Microsoft's documentation on Hologram Stability.

    XR: Added new UI to Daydream VR Device configuration, to support new 6DOF Standalone devices.

    XR: Added XR support to Experimental Scriptable Render Pipelines.

    Android: Removed "Export as ADT project" option.

    Asset Import: TextScriptImporter now recognises Markdown files (.md).

    Editor: Added methods EditorGUI.EnumFlagsField and EditorGUILayout.EnumFlagsField, which respect the values of the enum type and support custom names for values 0 and ~0 (all bits set). Deprecated methods EditorGUI.EnumMaskField, EditorGUILayout.EnumMaskField, EditorGUI.EnumMaskPopup, and EditorGUILayout.EnumMaskPopup, which always assume values to be 1, 2, 4, 8 (and so on). (896176)

    Package Manager: Added upmResetToEditorDefaults command-line option and menu item to reset packages to Editor defaults.

    Profiler: Improved profiler data serialization for Players - lower memory overhead, better performance.

    Shaders: Concatenated matrix macros (e.g. UNITY_MATRIX_MVP) are now changed to static variables to avoid repeated calculations.

    Substance: Deprecated built-in support for Substance Designer materials. This support will be removed in 2018.1. To continue using Substance Designer materials in Unity 2018.1, you need to install a suitable third-party external importer from the Asset Store.

    UI: Unity no longer resets the LookDev camera when you create a new Scene. (938493)

    XR: Improved the way XR devices pause/unpause applications, particularly when pausing as a result of application focus being lost. Unity now handles overlapping pause conditions correctly, regardless of the order in which they occur.

    XR: Removed padding on double-wide texture used with Single Pass.

Improvements

    2D: Exposed methods to set and retrieve Physics Shape from a Sprite.

    2D: If you use Shift-Click to do picking for Tile Palette, Unity now switches back to the original tool after picking is done.

    Android: [OpenGL ES] Added support for preserving the framebuffer alpha.

    Animation: Added a 2D mode to the Animation Previewer.

    Animation: Added new Translation DoFs for Arms, Legs and Head for Humanoid animation and retargeting. This converts translations (also known as stretch) found on imported animations to retargetable Humanoid animations.

    Animation: Added zoom in the Animator Window.

    Animation: Entry, Exit and AnyState StateMachine Transitions can now be copy-pasted. (921705)

    Animation: Framing a single key does not give proper context for manipulation in the curve editor, so we included neighbouring keys.

    Asset Import: Added Preserve Hierarchy toggle to the Model Importer, to prevent Unity stripping the root transform when the model has a single root.

    Asset Import: Added AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessMaterial.

    Asset Import: Exposed ModelImporter.MaterialLocation to allow you to switch the Iaterial import location in AssetPostprocessor scripts.

    Asset Import: Material workflow enhancement: added the ability to remap all embedded materials to existing material assets in the project, using the same heuristics as the legacy system

    Asset Import: You can now skip Video Clip transcoding during import. If you do so, Unity uses a non-transcoded version of the video instead.

    DX12: Native Rendering Plugin: Exposed and implemented native RenderBuffer resource retrieval, and fixed multithreading issues.

    Editor: Added UnityEngine.Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectedPlayer.Name. This makes it easier for you to identify connected players.

    Editor: Connected Players now only show debug logging in Editor console, not all of stdout. Added an option to disable player logging in the Editor console.

    Editor: Fixed over 120 missing or incomplete tooltips in the Unity Editor.

    Editor: If Edit mode and Play mode tests produce files without proper cleanup, Unity now logs a warning.

    Editor: It is now possible to adjust the number of lines per log row in the Console window.

    Editor: Updated UnityShaderCompiler tool for macOS and Linux to 64bit. This improves shader compilation performance.

    Editor: You can now double-click a Scene file in the Build List to highlight Scenes in the Project view.

    Editor: You can now select which Xcode version to build your project with on MacOS.

    GI: Before, all trees, lightmap static or not, would cast baked shadows on Terrain. Now Unity honors the Static flag on the prefab.

    GI: Fixed debugging textures for GI. It's now easier to tell when they should be availble, and why they might be missing.

    GI: Legacy trees and prefabs that don't have a LOD group now cast baked shadows on Terrain. (685764)

    GI: Made spot light and point light fall-off match real-time fall-off in Progressive Lightmapper.

    Graphics: Added "base vertex" functionality to Mesh.SetIndices, to allow meshes larger than 65k vertices when using 16 bit index buffer..

    Graphics: Added GPU selection in metal for MacEditor and MacStandalonePlayer.

    Graphics: Added non-allocating overloads for GeometryUtility.CalculateFrustumPlanes.

    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Instance properties are now packed as arrays of structures. Internally, we changed the constant buffer layout, where multiple instance properties are present. There are three changes in the instancing declaration macros, but the old shaders can be upgraded automatically. For your reference, the three changes are:
        UNITY_INSTANCING_CBUFFER_START/END renamed to UNITY_INSTANCING_BUFFER_START/END.
        UNITY_INSTANCING_BUFFER_END now takes an arrayName in the parentheses.
        UNITY_ACCESS_INSTANCED_PROP must now be provided with the arrayName in the first argument to indicate where this property comes from. Note that if graphics jobs are not enabled, the CPU-side processing of instance property values are optimized and off-loaded to a worker thread to further reduce CPU cost.

    Graphics: GPU Instancing: Introduced a new feature on most platforms, called "flexible instancing array sizes". This means you no longer need to specify instancing array sizes. Instead, Unity calculates it from the next draw's instance count.
        This greatly reduces shader compiling time for instancing variants.
        If you always take the maximum constant buffer size allowed by the device, then divide by the instance data structure size, you can further reduce instance batch count, especially on OpenGL and Metal.
        This introduces moderate performance improvements, especially for Scenes with lots of small batches. particularly useful if you rely on Unity renderloops to automatically batch instances for you.

    Graphics: Improved documentation for graphics hardware tiers.

    Graphics: Improved motion vectors precision when dynamic batching is disabled.

    Graphics: Introduced various performance and memory consumption optimizations to the Vulkan renderer.

    Graphics: Optimized Point Light real-time shadows for D3D11.

    Physics: Introduced Cloth self-collision and inter-collision tools and technology. Improved constraint painting.

    Profiler: Added experimental option to use Deep Profiler in Players with Mono runtime.

    Scripting: Added a fastpath which avoids boxing of value types when a UnityEvent invokes listeners with the exact same argument types (932039)

    Testing: Introduced [RequirePlatformSupport] in the Editor Tests framework, allowing tests to be marked as requiring support for particular platforms to be installed.

    Testing: The -testCategory command line argument (to select the category of tests to run) now supports regular expressions.

    Timeline: Introduced various clip snap improvements:
        Improved snap precision
        Added Multi-selection clip snap support
        Added double side snap hint
        You can now hold down Ctrl to toggle snapping when moving clips
        No snapping on Muted tracks
        Auto snapping on Clip Asset duration and loop ends

    Timeline: Made improvements to the Copy/Paste workflow.

    UI: All Editor tab views now use FitToContents for button contents with flexible space on either side of toolbar, instead of filling window width.
