5.0.4f1 Release notes
Improvements

    Android: Audio - Enabled OpenSL for GearVR.
    iOS/IL2CPP: Load embedded resource files as memory mapped read-only files so that they do not contribute to memory pressure.
    iOS/IL2CPP: Lower memory used by IL2CPP executables at runtime by removing unused overhead from memory profiling.
    Xbox One: Unity is now build with the June 2015 XDK. You must have the June 2015 XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or later recovery.

    (698060) - iOS/IL2CPP: Corrected an error in generated code when a constrained generic parameter type is used in a nested lambda expression.
    (698589) - iOS/IL2CPP: Corrected RPC implementation for the UnityEngine.Networking namespace.
    (704018) - iOS/IL2CPP: Ensure that GetCurrentMethod returns the proper value, even when the generated native method is inlined.
    (695179) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed a crash which occurred when Ldvirtftn opcode was used on a non-virtual method.
    (691404) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed a rare case when bytecode stripper would incorrectly strip wrong overloaded generic virtual method.
    (694535) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed an issue which sometimes caused IL2CPP to not call static constructors when Unity created class instances from native code.
    (696986) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed ConstructorInfo.Invoke() returning null for Nullable types.
    (694436) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed IL2CPP generated code in if (...) block if the condition operand was an IntPtr.
    (694436) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed IL2CPP generated marshaling code for marshaling IntPtr into any other primitive type.693316
    (673249) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed managed stack traces.
    (702879) - iOS/IL2CPP: Fixed marshaling arrays of structs marked with [Out] attribute.
    (697563) - iOS/IL2CPP: Generate correct C++ code for a generic virtual method which returns an IEnumerator and has a generic constraint defined on the method it overrides.
    (696187) - iOS/IL2CPP: Pr700531event a C++ compiler error in generated code about an undeclared identifier with the test "Unused local just for stack balance".
    (702696) - iOS/IL2CPP: Prevent a runtime exception with IL code in an enumerator's MoveNext method when the enumerator's return type is a constrained generic type.
    (703294) - iOS/IL2CPP: Prevent an exception during code generation when the default value of a field is not the same type as the field.
    (704069) - iOS/IL2CPP: Prevent the player build process from using older generated C++ source files from a previous build.
    (691008) - iOS/IL2CPP: When compiling scripts for the player, appropriate UnityEngine.UI.dll will be referenced.
    (671681) - Lighting: Fixed inaccurate screenspace scissoring of lights with large range.
    (none) - Mono: Double traverse object count to avoid stack overflow when freeing huge amounts of objects.
    (none) - Windows Store Apps: Fixed a rare crash at boot when reading AppxManifest.xml.
    (690152) - Xbox One: Fixed a bug that could cause game chat to fail when more than two players are involved.
