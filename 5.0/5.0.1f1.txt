5.0.1f1 Release notes
Improvements

    Android: Added framebuffer clear on devices that would prefer framebuffer discard but don't have the required GLES extension.
    Android: Added profiling stats for blit to screen and input processing.
    Android: Joystick input optimization, fixes slowdown on some older devices.
    Android: Parsing device specific XML font configurations to determine system/fallback fonts in addition to the hard-coded list of font names (in 4.6.4 too).

    GI: Allow higher AO exponent in Lighting window.
    GI: Don't calculate AO when AO exponent is 0.
    GI: Fixed inconsistent Enlighten build timings; now it should correspond to wall clock time (unless you move at near speed of light relative to your computer, in which case it might still be wrong).
    GI: Moved baked tag to the proper place in UI.
    GI: Output more stats per system and in total: vertex count, face count, chart count and texel count.
    GI: Removed an unnecessary warning that realtime GI is not supported on PS3 and Xbox360 when finishing a bake in non-continuous mode.

    Physics 2D: Joint2D property 'collideConnected' renamed to 'enableCollision' to match 3D physics.
    Physics 2D: PlatformEffector2D property renames based upon feedback: oneWay->useOneWay, sideFriction->useSideFriction and sideBounce->useSideBounce.
    Platforms: Unity Professional users can now optionally show the builtin Unity Splash Screen on applicable platforms, in Player Settings.
