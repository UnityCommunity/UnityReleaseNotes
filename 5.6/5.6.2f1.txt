Unity 5.6.2f1
Released 21 Jun, 2017

Release notes
Improvements

    Android: Enabled NEON in Umbra.
    Animation: Optimized evaluation of complex blend trees, and blend trees with empty child nodes.
    Graphics: Added R8 and RG16 Texture formats, and RGBAUShort and RG16 Render Texture formats.
    Improved Outline Editor module performance in Sprite Editor Window.
    IOS: Added support for the 5th generation iPad.
    Networking: Added a timeout property to UnityWebRequest. This gives coarse grain control over timeouts for webrequests.
    Physics 2D: SpriteRenderer's Sprite Tiling behavior changed when width/height is negative value.
    Physics 2D:Update BoxCollider2D Sprite Tiling generation to produce cleaner shape
    UI: CanvasRenderer::OnTransformChanged will not be called when object is inactive. (815861)
    Video: Optimized video decoding directly into RenderTexture if it is the same size as the video stream
    Video: Skip-ahead functionality improvements.
    VR: Updated Oculus to version 1.14.

Changes

    GI: Added support for LOD baking in Progressive Lightmapper. Light Probes are not necessary anymore when baking LODs using Progressive Lightmapper.
    GI: Support for double sided materials in Progressive Lightmapper. Added a new material setting that causes lighting to interact with backfaces. When enabled, both sides of the geometry get accounted for when calculating Global Illumination. Backfaces do not count as invalid when seen from other objects. Backface rendering is not controlled by this setting nor will backfaces be represented in the lightmaps. Backfaces bounce light using the same emission and albedo as frontfaces.
