5.4.0b2 Release notes
System Requirements Changes

    Webplayer no longer supported and will be removed
    iOS will require 7.0 or higher (dropping 6.0)

Known Issues

    Creating a scene from the Project Browser's 'Create' menu currently crashes Unity. Use the 'New Scene' option from the main menu instead.
    Fallback from Deferred to Forward when rendering lightmapped objects with mixed-mode light - can be fixed by introduction of baked shadow mask for lightmapped objects
    GPU Instancing: When drawing meshes with instancing shaders by Graphics.DrawMesh, Unity fails to render with correct mesh.
    Legacy Animation: Changes to the lights in 5.3 have caused an issue so that it currently is not possible to animate lights using the Legacy animation system. Fix arrived in 5.3, and is being forward ported soon.
    Saving a scene on OSX might throw the error in the console: "TLS Allocator ALLOC_TEMP_THREAD..". Happens only on OSX El Capitan (10.11.1). Doesn't happen on OSX 10.10;
    WebPlayer build is not removed. Expect its removal in a future beta.

Features

    2D: 9-Slice sprites.
    Asset Import: Support importing models with more than 100,000 objects
    GI: Light Probe Proxy Volumes
    This component allows using more than one light probe sample for large dynamic objects (think large particle systems or important characters). This will sample probes into a 3D texture and use that in the shader.
        Requires shader model 4 (DX11+/PS4/XB1/GLCore).
    GI: Occlusion of the strongest mixed mode light is stored per light probe
    Graphics: Basic GPU Instancing Support
        Use GPU instancing to draw a large amount of identical geometries with very few draw calls.
        Works with MeshRenderers that use the same material and the same mesh.
        Only needs a few changes to your shader to enable it for instancing.
        Set per-instance shader properties from script via MaterialPropertyBlock.
        Supported on Windows DX11/DX12 with SM 4.0 and up. Other platforms will be supported later.
    Graphics: Fast texture copies via Graphics.CopyTexture.
    Graphics: Texture Array support, seeTexture2DArray class.
    IAP: Cloud catalog support
    A 'useCloudCatalog' boolean has been added to UnityEngine.Purchasing.ConfigurationBuilder. When set, Unity IAP will fetch your catalog of products for sale from the Unity cloud. Catalog is configured via the Unity Analytics dashboard.
    iOS: Add URL schemes player setting
    OSX: Editor enabled retina support (text and some icons only)
    Particles: Trigger Module
    Physics: Overlap recovery, used to depenetrate CharacterControllers from static objects when an overlap is detected. When activated, the CharacterController module will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move the CharacterController to a safe place where it does not overlap other objects anymore.
    Shaders: Uniform array support
        Uniform arrays can be set by new array APIs on MaterialPropertyBlock.
        The size of an array is lifted to 1023.
        The old way of setting array elements by using number-suffixed names is deprecated.
    Substance: Substance: ProceduralMaterials are now supported at runtime on Windows Store/Phone platforms
    Windows: Added speech recognition APIs under UnityEngine.Windows.Speech. These APIs are supported on all windows platforms as long as they're running on Windows 10: Windows Editor, Windows Standalone and Windows Store
    Windows Store: Realtime global illumination now works when using Windows 10 SDK
    Windows Store: UnityWebRequest now supported for all SDKs

Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes

    Android: WebCam no longer works on Gingerbread devices
    DX12: Introduced a new native plugin interface - IUnityGraphicsD3D12v2 . The old interface will not function anymore due to differences in internal graphics job submission.
    Editor: Deprecated UnityEditor.ShaderUtil.ShaderPropertyTexDim; use Texture.dimension.
    GI: Deprecated Light.actuallyLightmapped, use Light.isBaked and Light.bakedIndex instead. Baked Light got unique index, instead of the flag "actuallyLightmapped"
    Graphics: Further deprecated Material(String) constructor - this will now always create a material with the error shader and print an error, in editor and player. It will be completely removed in a future Unity version.
    Playables: refactored API so that Playables are struct instead of classes. Making the API allocation-less in c#.
    Scripting: Added two new script errors in the editor for catching calls to the Unity API during serialization. See "Scripting Serialization" page in the manual for more details.
    Scripting: To facilitate a memory optimization, UnityEngine.Object.GetInstanceID() is no longer thread safe.
    Web: WebRequest interface was promoted from UnityEngine.Experimental.Networking to UnityEngine.Networking. Unity 5.2 and 5.3 projects that use UnityWebRequest will have to be updated.

Changes

    Android: Assets - Disable texture streaming for Android
    Android: Removed native activity implementation. An activity with the same name based on a regular Activity is still in place for backwards compatibility reasons.
    Android: UnityPlayerNativeActivity and UnityPlayerProxyActivity has been deprecated and will print warnings to the logcat if in use.
    Audio: Streamed audio clips are no longer preloaded. This is done to reduce the number of open file handles in scenes referencing a large number of streamed clips. Except for a slight increase in playback latency the behaviour is not affected.
    Audio: Updated FMOD to 4.44.56
    DX12: Disabled client/worker mode as a preparation step for pure threading (-force-gfx-mt now does nothing for DX12).
    DX12: Enabled GPU profiler in single-threaded mode (-force-gfx-direct).
    Editor: Editor will warn opening a project from any version not matching the projects matching last version string saved in information. This means even 5.4.0b1 to 5.4.0b2, or 5.4.0f3 to 5.4.0p1
    Physics: Fix for Character Controller Physics causing capsule to be thrown in the air when exiting another collider
    Samsung TV: Added Ignore BG Alpha Clear checkbox to Resolution section of Samsung TV player settings. This will disable the clearing of the alpha value for the background fill allowing for blending between Unity's render layer and the layer behind.
    Shaders: Internal shader for computing screenspace cascaded shadows was moved into Graphics Settings. If you were overriding it before by just dropping it into the project -- now need the custom one via Graphics Settings.
    Shaders: Removed support for EXT_shadow_samplers on non-iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 platform. Almost no devices outside of iOS have it, so there's no point in having larger shaders for that.
    Terrain: Now terrain objects created in the scene will be properly renamed to avoid using the same name.
    Terrain: When different TerrainData are used for Terrain and TerrainCollider component on one GameObject, a warning message is shown and a button to help fix the situation.

Improvements

    2D: Added tessellation detail control to SpriteEditor
    Android: Added template for ProGuard obfuscation on exported project
    Android: Application name now supports non-alphanumeric characters and spaces
    Android: Converted some fatal error messages to be presented on screen rather than printed to the logcat
    Android: Enhanced robustness of Location input
    Animation: Improved Animation event performance for repeat calls to the same events on components
    Audio: Added virtualization of audio effects. For audio sources that are virtual because they have been culled due to low audibility or priority attached effect components or spatializers are now bypassed too in order to save CPU. The new behaviour is on by default but can be turned off in the audio project settings.
    Audio: Audio clip waveform preview now displays the actual format used for compression when the default format isn’t available on a certain platform.
    Audio: Fixed audio clip waveform preview rendering sync issues after import and improved the way the waveforms are being rendered to be more dynamic and reveal more detail.
    Cache Server: Cache server: Improved the cache server so that it can properly handle scenarios when assets with missing references are being read.
    Compute: Add DispatchIndirect function (similar to DrawProceduralIndirect - dispatching compute shader with parameters sourced from ComputeBuffer)
    Compute: Improve error handling for compute shaders
    Compute: Revamp API of hidden counters on ComputeBuffers to be more sane. Now optionally reset when bound, and can be explicitly set via SetCounterValue
    Core: Add more profiling information to the PersistentManager
    Core: Improved job execution. Spawn worker threads based on the number of logical processors instead of physical cores.
    DX12: Introduced -force-d3d12-stablepowerstate command line parameter. Use it when profiling the GPU.
    Editor: Added a warning if there are still managed threads running after exiting play-mode. The editor only stops all managed play-mode threads when entering play-mode and recompiling scripts.
    Editor: Always show the scene headers in the Hierarchy (also when only having one scene) to prevent confusion when loading and unloading scenes in play mode (scene headers was popping in and out). Also it makes it possible to see what scene is loaded in OSX fullscreen mode.
    Editor: Fixed the title of the Script Execution Order inspector
    Editor: In play mode the DontDestroyOnLoad scene will only be shown if it has game objects
    GI: Added Lightmapping.realtimeGI and Lightmapping.bakedGI editor APIs

    GI: Fixed a problem where we would always recompute Final Gather even if the result was in the cache.
    GI: Improved mixing of realtime and baked shadows - removes shadow from the back-facing geometry, preserves bounce and contribution of other baked lights
    GI: Store BakeEnlightenProbeSetJob results in hashed file to speed up rebaking of light probes.
    GI: Upgraded to Enlighten 3.03
    GI: Use HDR color picker for ambient color instead of color plus ambient intensity.
    Graphics: Added mechanism to tweak some unity shader defines per-platform per-shader-hardware-tier. Currently it is exposed only to scripts: see UnityEditor.Rendering namespace, specifically UnityEditor.Rendering.PlatformShaderSettings for tweakable settings and UnityEditor.Rendering.EditorGraphicsSettings for methods to get/set shader settings. Please note, that if settings are different for some tiers, shader variants for ALL tiers will be compiled, but duplicates will be still stripped from final build.
    Graphics: Added TextureDimension enum, and Texture.dimension property.
    Graphics: Allow setting a slice of 3D/2DArray as a render target (Graphics.SetRenderTarget depthSlice argument).
    Graphics: LOD: Reduced render batch breaking overhead due to LOD fading.
    iOS: Use new Game Center APIs when possible
    Physics: Added 'OneWayGrouping' property to PlatformEffector2D to group contacts.
    Physics: Allow point editing in Inspector for Edge/PolygonCollider2D.
    Scripting: Added new yield instruction: WaitForSecondsRealtime.
    Scripting: Improved SendMessage performance for repeat calls to the same message on components
    Scripting: ScriptUpdater asks whether to automatically update once per project session (i.e, a different project gets open or unity is restarted)
    Shaders: #pragma target 3.5, 4.5, 4.6 are accepted.
        3.5 - minimum version for texture arrays (DX11 SM4.0+, GL3+, GLES3+, Metal)
        4.5 - minimum version for compute shaders (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.3+, GLES3.1+)
        4.6 - minimum version for tessellation (DX11 SM5.0+, GL4.1+, GLES3.1AEP+)
    Shaders: Added shader #pragma to allow easy/cheap variants of shaders across different tiers of hardware in the same renderer without needing keywords (e.g. iPhone 4 and iPhone 6, within gles)
    Shaders: Extended Standard Shader UI, new options to disable specular highlights, reflections and to pack Smoothness into the alpha channel of the Albedo texture
    StackTrace: Deprecated Application.stackTraceLogType, use Application.SetStackTraceLogType/GetStackTraceLogType instead.
    StackTrace: For StacktraceLogtype.None only the message will be printed (without file name or line number).
    StackTrace: You can now set stacktrace log type in PlayerSettings for various log types.
    Windows Store: System.operatingSystem will add '64 bit' postfix if target device has 64 bit CPU, more information in the docs.
    Windows Store: Added bluetooth capability to player settings
    Windows Store: Added UnityEngine.Ping class.
    Windows Store: In player settings visual asset images are now edited using object fields
    Windows Store: PDBs will now be included in the installers for "Release" players too (debug and master players already had PDBs included)
