Unity 5.5.4f1
Released 7 Jun, 2017


Release notes
Improvements

    Added support for the 5th generation iPad.
    AssetBundles: Reduced SerializedFile memory usage when reading streams inside AssetBundles.
    Build Pipeline: Exceptions thrown during the build process (e.g. by user callbacks) are now treated the same as logged errors, from a reporting and StrictMode point of view.
    Graphics: Added function to allow cube map textures to be compressed from script like their Texture2D counterparts
    Networking: Added a timeout property to UnityWebRequest. This gives coarse grain control over timeouts for webrequests. (900900)
    Unity Ads: Updated native binaries to 2.1.0
    VR: Updated Oculus to version 1.14.

Changes

    VR: You can enable GPU skinning for Android VR. This is experimental, and you should verify behavior and performance on the target devices.
