5.2.0f1 Release notes

Upgrade Guide
Known issues

We are doing something new by giving more prominence to known issues and the upcoming patch release in which we expect to fix them. So, while the known issue list might look a bit longer, we're doing this to provide transparency and to increase the amount of information you get about our development process.

    2D: Sprite pivot values currently clamped to 0..1, will be extended to larger values in 5.2.0p1
    Connect: 'Go to Dashboard' link for Multiplayer leads to Cloud Build
    Editor: Crash when using injecting proxies (e.g. Lavasoft's webcompanion, Astrill, Qustodio) 713828
    Editor: Incorrectly reports native plugin collision, even if only one native plugin exists
    Game input in the Mac Editor may not work after opening a new project. This happens after getting a dialog saying “Moving File Failed”. To work around this issue, close and open the editor. The fix will be in 5.2.0p1 705555
    Mac: Input system such as mouse click events or key press events stop working when multiple projects are opened. The fix will be in 5.2.0p1 716221
    Layout elements under a ScrollRect component may not work properly. As a workaround a setup can be used where the Content is not a direct child of the ScrollRect but has an intermediary View object in between (the default setup from 5.2 onwards). The fix will be in a patch release
    Editor: Scene view picking in linear color space does not work for DX11 when MSAA is used (quality: fantastic). Workaround: Use gamma color space, turn off MSAA or switch to DX9. This will be fixed in 5.2.0p1
    Version Control: Perforce "Moving file failed" message appears when close project, fixed in 5.2.0p1
    Windows Phone: Solution build fails when product name has non-alphanumeric characters
    Windows Phone 10: Virtual keyboard doesn't work for UWP apps, will be fixed in 5.2.0p1
    Windows Store Apps: audio is buggy on Windows 10, will be fixed in 5.2.0p1
    Universal Windows Platform: Unity C# option doesn't work correctly for Windows 10 Universal apps, will be fixed in 5.2.0p1
    Windows Store Apps: webcam is crashing on Windows 10, will be fixed in 5.2.0p1
    VR / Oculus Windows: Linear lighting and MSAA crashes. Must use gamma, no MSAA until 5.2.0p1
    VR / Oculus Windows: HMD not rendering after reconnect on Win10 with runtime 0.7
    VR / Oculus Mac: No image to HMD. No workaround until 5.2.0p1
    VR / Gear VR: Crash with OpenGL ES 2.0. Must use OpenGL ES 3.0 until 5.2.0p1
    Tizen: Applications currently crash on launch. Will be fixed in a patch-release
    Tizen: Applications will be rejected by the Tizen Store. Will be fixed in a patch-release

Features

    2D: Ability to rotate sprites while Sprite Packing to save atlas space description
    Android: Experimental support for IL2CPP scripting backend
    Android: Audio - Enable OpenSL fast path for devices that support FEATURE_AUDIO_LOW_LATENCY
    Android: ETC1 Compression for Sprite Atlases. The texture is split into two RGB parts (second part containing alpha information as a grayscale) and combined in the shader. The option can be set on a per texture level, which affects the final atlas the texture lands in
    Audio: Ability to set custom rolloff curves for an AudioSource at runtime via script. The following curves will be able to be set at runtime: Volume Rolloff, Spatial Blend (2D / 3D), Reverb Zone Mix, Spread, LowPass Filter Cutoff Frequency
    Audio: Spatialization API for audio plugins, see (SDK and example)[https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/nativeaudioplugins]

description description

    Cloud Services: Access control list support
    Core: Application.UnloadLevel. Unloading scenes is now possible while the game is running. References to lightmaps are cleared but you have to call Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() to actually unload them. Enlighten data is unloaded immediately. This feature is especially useful in conjunction with Lightmapping.BakeMultipleLevels()
    Graphics: Added CullingGroup API, which allows you to specify a large set of bounding spheres that are integrated into the culling pipeline and subjected to frustum and occlusion culling

    Graphics: Added option in player settings for configurable vertex compression. Default values: position and UV1 is uncompressed, the rest of the channels are compressed description

    Mecanim: Playable API. Supports creating Animation blending graphs at runtime, providing the capacity to have full control over the AnimationClips and AnimationControllers played by the engine.
    Mecanim: 3ds Max Auto Mapping and T-Pose. When setting an Avatar Animation Type to Humanoid, the Auto-Configure will try to detect if it is a Biped. If the hierarchy and naming of Biped is found, then default mapping and t-pose for biped will be used. Translation DoF will also be automatically activated for that avatar. The avatar can still be re-configured from this point, but usually default Biped mapping, t-pose and translation DoF will give the best results. Note that only Bipeds with no “Triangle Pelvis” and using default naming are supported

    Mecanim: Translation DoF for Humanoid. Some animation files come with translation animation on humanoid bones. For example, it is the case with 3ds Max Biped that comes with translation on 1st Spine bone. Translation DoF can be activated on those humanoid avatar to convert translation animation to retargetable translation DoFs. Translation DoF affects Spine, Shoulders, Upper Legs and Neck bones. Translation DoFs usually represent small amount of translation that improves retargeting quality. Translation DoF may also be used to improve retargeting quality when animation has more than two animated spine bones. Translation DoF can be activated in Muscle & Setting tab of Humanoid configure window description

    Multi Scene Lighting baking. Lightmapping.BakeMultipleScenes lets you bake lightmaps, reflection probes and realtime lightmaps for multiple scenes together, which can be loaded additively. Data is automatically split on bake per scene
    Plugins: Expanded low-level graphics plugin API
    Out of the box support for VisualStudio Tools for Unity (aka UnityVS)
    Performance: CPU side rendering performance optimizations across the board. We've seen between 5% and 30% lower CPU cost for rendering, depending on the setup. Sorting of the renderable objects is now multithreaded too

description

    Performance: Improved performance of LoadAssetAsync. Allow multiple AsyncOperations to be completed in a single frame
    Performance: Particle rendering optimizations (especially for VR), with speed improvements varying from 15% to 50% depending on geometry type
    Performance: Rendering on Linux uses the same main+render thread setup as on other platforms
    Performance: UI now uses multithreaded batching & geometry generation backend. This leads to a performance increase of up 4x in our stress test scenes
    Physics: Added parameter QueryTriggerInteraction to all physics queries (raycast, spherecast, overlap) to allow any query to override whether or not the query should hit Triggers
    Physics: Expose CharacterController.skinWidth parameter to scripts
    Physics: Expose impulse applied at contact (see Collision.impulse)
    Physics: Support scaling of vehicles
    Shaders: Fixed Function shaders work on all platforms now (including consoles). They are always generated at shader import time (a button "show generated code" in shader inspector shows the code); removed all runtime support. All rendering got slightly faster (even when not using fixed function shaders); and executable sizes got slightly smaller. MaterialPropertyBlocks work with them now (which means Sprites and animated materials work too). Behave more consistently across platforms (specular highlights and light attenuation was slightly different before). Fixed function shaders aren't rasterized at a half-pixel shift on WP8 anymore. However, can not create fixed function shaders using "new Material(string)" at runtime anymore; see Changes section
    UI: 2D Rect Mask. A mask for 2D UI elements. Performs faster than the previous stencil buffer mask and does not require additional draw calls to prime the stencil buffer. When an element is outside the bounds of the mask the canvas renderer is also culled which leads to faster batching performance

    UI: Dropdown control. The Dropdown can be used to let the user choose a single option from a list of options. description

    UI: New Scroll View menu item and improved support in ScrollRect component for scrollbars.
    Unity Ads: Enable and configure Ads from the Unity Connect window in the Editor
    WebGL: allow .jspre files to be added to the project to be prefixed to the generated JavaScript
    WebGL: Experimental support for WebGL 2.0 (not yet supported in any released browser)
    Windows Store Apps: Universal Windows Platform app (Windows 10) support

Changes

    Blackberry: Discontinued Blackberry player support
    Editor: Asset Store window is now a part of the default window layout. Docked behind the scene & game views
    Editor: Remove legacy Mac OS X corner window resize behaviour
    GI: Set default BounceScale to 1
    Graphics: Material.CopyPropertiesFromMaterial also copies shader keywords and render queue now
    IL2CPP: Make engine stripping in iOS/WebGL a separate setting (PlayerSettings.stripEngineCode) from Mono stripping levels
    Introduce EditorSettings.projectGenerationUserExtensions & EditorSettings.projectGenerationBuiltinExtensions
    Particles: Particle geometry is generated in world space now (used to be in view space before). If you have custom particle shaders that relied on view space positions coming in, you will need to change them
    Reflection Probes: Are rendered in a separate deferred pass when using deferred shading. See Improvements section entry for details
    Scripting: Removed hexadecimal color string support from Color and replaced with ColorUtility
    Shaders: Can not create fixed function shaders using "new Material(string)" anymore. Shaders must come from assets or be fully precompiled in the editor
    Shaders: Changed UnityGlobalIllumination, Unity_GlossyEnvironment, FragmentGI function signatures. If you have custom shaders that uses Unity's PBR please check UnityGlobalIllumination.cginc, UnityStandardBRDF.cginc, UnityStandardCore.cginc respectively
    Substance: The communication between Unity's MainThread and the Substance Thread was completely rewritten to better decouple Substance processing from Unity's regular operations and to avoid stalling the MainThread. All crashes and hangs at build time, level load/change time, playmode entry/exit should be gone
    Terrain: Changed the default hotkey bindings for terrain tools to F1-F6
    UI: CanvasRenderer can now take multiple Materials. Like a MeshRenderer each material refers to a SubMesh of the configured Mesh
    UI: CanvasRenderer now takes a Mesh instead of List this allows for the use of imported meshs as part of the UI
    UI: UI.Text now accounts for trailing white spaces when performing horizontal alignment
    WebGL: Make release builds always fully optimized
    Windows Store Apps: AppCallbacks.LoadGfxNativePlugin has been deprecated. All plugins that are in the project and set to build for a given platform are now loaded automatically. The function still exists and does nothing, but it will be removed in a future Unity version

Improvements
2D Improvements

    Allow sprites to be dragged into scene view in 3d mode. Add temp GO while dragging for visual feedback similar to when dragging prefabs/model into scene view
    Frame selected command (F) now works in the sprite editor window for the selected sprite rect
    Implement undo functionality for sprite editor window's slice menu
    New grid slicing method that uses column and row count
    Pivot snapping on sprite frame rect in sprite editor window only happens when Ctrl is pressed while mouse dragging the pivot handle
    Provide a custom pivot field in the slicing menu for the sprite editor window
    Zooming on sprite editor window’s texture will zoom towards mouse cursor

Editor Improvements

    Added RunOpenPanelWithFilters API
    Better error message when "The classes in the module cannot be loaded" is thrown
    Improved Compute Shader inspector; now lists errors & warnings similar to regular shader inspector
    Improved Export Package window (now uses a proper tree view)
    Improved shader inspector performance when there are many errors shown
    Make sure ObjectField and Object Selector shows icons for game objects and prefabs
    More "create new shader" templates under assets create menu (PBS surface shader, unlit shader, image effect shader)
    Selection.selectionChange callback triggered when selection changes
    Show proper cubemap preview instead of icon in large preview ObjectField
    When in 2D mode, the camera bounds for the main camera is always visible when it is in orthographic mode

Graphics, Lightmapping and Shader Improvements

    GI: Added progress bar for GI Cache -> Clean Cache progress status
    GI: Allow ambient intensity higher than 1
    GI: Size of the last lightmap is now reduced to pack the instances more tightly and not waste space
    Graphics: Add SetUVs to Mesh API, it takes a UV channel, and a List of either Vector2, Vector3, or Vector4 as arguments
    Graphics: Added a quality setting 'Shadow near plane offset' to allow working around shadow pancaking artifacts
    Graphics: Added CommandBuffer.IssuePluginEvent to allow invoking native code plugin from a command buffer
    Graphics: Added Cubemap.mipmapCount
    Graphics: Implemented object naming for D3D11, so textures and meshes will pick up the correct name in external graphics debuggers (e.g. RenderDoc, NSight etc.)
    Graphics: Memory saving for meshes with < 300 vertices if dynamic batching is off
    Graphics: New GL.IssuePluginEvent override allows invoking a specific callback in a specific native plugin
    Graphics: Windows Store Apps 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 now support MSAA
    Image Effects: Added option to disable 'no fog on skybox pixels' behaviour in GlobalFog effect
    OpenGL: Added -force-clamped argument that prevents use of all available extensions when used together with -force-glcoreXX or -force-glesXX
    OpenGL: Added -force-gles editor and standalone player to automatically run with the best version of ES supported by the platform
    Particles: Mesh particles now support the Texture Sheet Animation settings
    Reflection Probes: when using Deferred Shading, the reflection probes are now rendered per-pixel (instead of each object only being affected by one or two probes)
    Shaders: Added finalgbuffer and finalprepass modifiers. They work in the same way as finalcolor does, but are used by the deferred and prepass base paths respectively for altering what would be written into the gbuffer
    Shaders: decal:add surface shaders now generate code for deferred and legacy deferred paths if finalgbuffer and finalprepass modifiers are specified
    Shaders: Now #pragma skip_variants skips user variants as well
    Shaders: Procedural Skybox shader now has selectable options for Sun Disk: None (fastest), Simple (should be close to the current sun disk), High Quality
    Shaders: Make it possible to use UNITY_SAMPLE_SHADOW macros when SHADOWS_NATIVE keyword is not explicitly defined

Mecanim Improvements

    Added a "destructive action" prompt when deleting blend tree nodes, so that the behaviour is consistent between StateMachine and BlendTree graphs
    Added AnimatorStateInfo.speed and AnimatorStateInfo.speedMultiplier
    Added the possibility to create AnyState Transitions to the entry node of a state machine. In a sub state machine, this is essentially the same as creating an AnyState Transition to a sub state machine from the parent state machine. This also adds a straightforward way to add an AnyState Transition to the top-level state machine, which was previously only possible through roundabout methods
    Added tracking of missing or invalid StateMachineBehaviours in the StateMachine and State inspectors. Missing or Invalid StateMachineBehaviours shouldn't disappear anymore from the inspector
    Adding a child blend tree will use the default blend tree parameter, not the blend parameter of the parent
    Alt-drag works in BlendTree graph view now
    BlendTree API publishes useAutomaticThresholds
    Can create new clip from selected clip/take in Animation importer
    Creating a blend tree in a controller with no float parameter will now automatically add a new float parameter named Blend
    Expose Animator.IsInitialized in scripting API
    Fixing empty State Machine Behaviour after compilation error
    Import humanoid animation warnings have been cleaned and improved. A “Warning” summary box has been added at the top of Animation Inspector to prevent warnings to be left unnoticed. Warnings are reported per take when animation file contains multiple takes. Warnings have been added when in-between humanoid bones rotation differs in Source Avatar and Animation. Text has been reformatted so that is easier to consult the warning report
    Improved default IK Hint for legs. Default IK Hint for knee now points towards foot direction. It gives a more natural IK solving for leg when IK correction needed gets bigger
    Improved display of transition previewer
    Improved Humanoid animation jitters (Humanoid Oversampling). For some animations, usually those with fast motion, the Humanoid interpolation may differ from original Euler rotation interpolation. In those rare cases, use animator.humanoidOversampling to increase sampling rate. ModelImporterHumanoidOversampling.X2 up to X8 can be used. Usually 2 will do the job! Default is X1 or no oversampling. Key reducing can be used conjointly to only keep Humanoid animation oversampled keys where it is needed while reducing asset size
    Renaming Animator parameters updates transitions using those parameters
    Retargeting quality for humanoid import animation. The retargeting quality compares original generic animation with humanoid retargeted animation. An average or maximum position error greater than 1.0 “normalized” mm will be reported. An average or maximum error greater than 0.5 degree will be reported. The time (and frame number) in full take of maximum errors is also reported. The position and rotation errors are reported per human body parts. The Retargeting Quality report can be turned on or off in Import Message foldout of Animation Inspector. It is off by default as it makes file import slower
    SetBoneLocalRotation. Animator.SetBoneLocalRotation let you modify the local rotation of humanoid bone during IK passes/OnAnimatorIK() callback. It can be used to modify the pose of a humanoid avatar after Animation Blending, but that will still be taken in account by IK Solving. Ex: Adjust Hips and Spine rotation to drive lower and upper body independently on top of animation

Networking Improvements

    Added OnLobbyServerPlayersReady callback to the NetworkLobbyManager to allow users to perform custom behaviour when all the players in the lobby are ready
    Added support for client-side authority for non-player objects. The new function NetworkServer.SpawnWithClientAuthority allows authority to be assigned to a client by its connection when an object is created
    Networking: Added support for network [Command] calls from non-player objects with authority on a client
    Networking: Added the ability for the NetworkTransform to validate on the server, the movement of authoritative client objects. There are now clientMoveCallback delegates on the NetworkTransform that allow user code to process 2D and 3D movement updates from clients before they are applied
    Networking: Added NetworkDiscovery component to network HLAPI. This exposes the network transport layer local discovery function to HLAPI code, and allows Unity games on a local network to find each other

Terrain Improvements

    A warning message will be printed onto the console window if there are too many vertices in a detail patch. Increased the vertex limit to from 50k to 65k.
    Deferred and legacy deferred rendering paths work again with Terrain
    Made it easier to work with height maps created by World Machine. The default value of Byte Order option is now Windows (little endian). Added an option to vertically flip the height map when importing or exporting a raw file
    Now 4097x4097 raw heightmap can be imported
    Now a TerrainData object embedded into a scene (created by script) allows scene objects being selected as tree prefabs
    SpeedTree: Negated tangent vectors to match those in the SpeedTree Modeler
    SpeedTree: Now shader has less variants due to the merge of some geometry types
    Trees painted on the terrain now are scaled by the prototype's transform scaling

    Physics: Now you can set negative WheelCollider.forceAppPointDistance. This allows to adjust forceAppPointDistance in order to have suspension and tire forces applied at the wheel base
    Physics: Renamed 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.None' to 'CollisionDetectionMode2D.Discrete' (scripts will be auto-updated)
    Scripting: Application.isShowingSplashScreen checks if Unity is currently showing a splash screen
    Stacktrace logging: Allow to log full (native/managed) stack trace when log is printed, the option is available in the console window in top right corner popup menu. Also check Application.stackTraceLogType API. Works in Editor and Windows/OSX standalone players
    Substance: "visibleIf" expressions set in Substance Designer are now properly evaluated (for inputs only) and inputs are now displayed or hidden accordingly
    Substance: Dynamic parameter in Substance graphs are now evaluated using native code instead of bytecode on Windows / OSX / Linux, resulting in faster texture generation
    Substance: Feature parity with Substance Designer 5.1
    Substance: Runtime generation of procedural materials is now supported on PS4 and XboxOne consoles
    TrueTypeFontImporter: References to other font assets to be used in the project as fallback are now shown in the TrueTypeFontImporter inspector

    UI: Make the default value for a slider / scrollbar be 0
    UI: Remove (Pro Only) from UI shaders as they can be used on any version of Unity 5
    Version Control: Bottom most version control info bar in inspector shows separate state for meta file if different from asset
    Version Control: Icon overlays for version control is surrounded by parenthesis in case an asset and its meta file's state is out of sync
    Version Control: Reduce unnecessary checkouts
    WebGL/IL2CPP: Improved stripping resulting in smaller build sizes
    WebGL: Resolution set in HTML file will no longer be overridden by PlayerSettings
    Windows Store Apps/Phone 8.1/Universal Apps: Unity will generate projects in a consistent way with Visual Studio. For ex., When specifying project names with whitespaces or symbols like '-', '.', Unity will no longer strip those symbols when creating folders, note this might break existing projects if you're building on top of old directory and your project name contains one of these symbols
    Windows Store Apps/Phone 8.1/Universal Apps: Unity will properly use project name instead of hardcoded "Template" word, when creating App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, MainPage.xaml, MainPage.xaml.cs, AssemblyInfo.cs files
