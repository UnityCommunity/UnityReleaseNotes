    Graphics: Fixed incorrect stripping of vertex streams in certain situations when a mesh has a mixture on lightmapped and non-lightmapped shaders; e.g. the vertex colour stream was previously being incorrectly stripped. (683178, 725562)
    Graphics: Fixed performance regressions due to shadow rendering jobs.
    IL2CPP: Allow the [Preserve] attribute to correctly prevent stripping of a method in a nested type. (738356)

    IL2CPP: Properly handle additional, subtraction, and multiplication when the type of the left argument is smaller than the type of the right argument and the result will not fit in the type of the left argument and the result is stored across an IL block. (745691)
    IL2CPP: Provide proper managed stack traces when the C++ compiler inlines method calls. (739956)
    IL2CPP: Treat assemblies mentioned in the link.xml file as roots for code conversion, but not as roots for code stripping. This corrects a regression in build size on iOS. (749728)
